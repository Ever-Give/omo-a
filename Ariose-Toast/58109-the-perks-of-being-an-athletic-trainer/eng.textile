Sam hurried into the locker room, her blonde bob bouncing as she carried a mess of clipboards and towels in her arms. Her job as a trainer for a women's soccer team was always busy, especially right after a match. They had just won an important cup fixture that meant they would be moving on to the quarter finals, and the players were making their way back to the locker room.

Even though the game was over, Sam was still in work mode. She still had to check in with the rest of the staff, make sure all the equipment got put back in the right place, and check up on the players for any minor injuries.

It was a hectic job at times, but there was no doubt Sam enjoyed it. She had worked hard to get to this spot. Plus, being surrounded by fit, attractive women running around in soccer shorts all day was definitely an added perk.

Not that she didnt keep it professional. She took her job seriously after all. But what she fantasized about ince she got home was her own business.

Just as she finally found a place to put down all the equipment, Sam began doing the rounds to check in on all the players. Fortunately, everyone seemed to be good, especially with everyone's spirits bolstered after the win. What soon caught her eye though was Mia, the team's star striker walking back to her locker a little bit gingerly.

It was probably nothing, but since no one else seemed to have any problems, Sam figured it wouldn't hurt. Not to mention that Mia was not only the best player and team captain, but easily the most gorgeous as well. Everything about her was perfect, from her long, toned legs to her sleek black hair tied back in a ponytail. Sam couldnt help but feel like a drooling, anxious mess around that girl.

"Hey, are you alright Mia?" Now that they were next to each other it made it obvious how tall Mia really was.

"Yeah, I'm fine," Mia replied, though her body language still felt tense.

"Oh, it just looked like you had a slight limp. I thought you might be hurt or something"

"Oh, uh ... I'm fine it's nothing, really." The tension in her voice was still there though.

"Are you sure? Dont be afraid to admit you're hurt. Even if it's only a minor injury, we still need to make sure you get prop-"

"Okay fine, Mia, look, I'm not hurt I just . . . I drank like a hundred gallons of water during the game and it's about to end up all over this fucking floor if you dont let me go like right now." Mia dashed off, nearly knocking Sam off balance and leaving her with a surprised expression on her face.

Once the postgame rush had died down a bit, Sam was organizing some equipment when Mia approached her again. She had already changed into her street clothes, but her jeans and T-shirt still gave her a sexy casual look that sent a shiver down Sam's spine.

"Hey Sam, sorry about earlier. I was a little brash and I ... think I almost knocked you over"

"Oh, dont worry about it," Sam laughed. God, the fact that Mia was apologizing so sweetly really turned her on for some reason. "I'd be the same way if someone got in the way of my emergency toilet break."

She was definitely able to relate. Sam had her fair share of being stuck on the sideline during a game with thousands of fans watching her try not to squirm as she struggled to contain her full bladder. Well, they were all focused on the game and not her, but at least that's what it felt like sometimes.

"Well I'm glad you understand," Mia laughed. "It actually happens a lot with the ridiculous amount we have to hydrate." Now that she thought about it, it wasnt uncommon for Sam to see a few girls make a beeline for the toilets right at halftime or the end of a game. Sometimes she was one of them.

"Anyways," Mia continued, putting her hand on Mia's shoulder, "I appreciate you were just trying to help. You've always done a really good job for the team, and your job is just as important as any of the players here."

The touch and high praise of the team's best player was a little too much for Sam to handle. "I, uh ... thanks" she managed to stammer.

"Anyways, I'll see you in practice this week" Mia said, and was off.

Sam's own bladder started to make itself known now that she had a second alone. She hadn't gone since before the game, but she had been so busy she hadn't noticed her bladder filling up. She thought about peeing before she packed up and left, but something compelled her to hold it until she got home.

Part 2 - Kinda short but there should be more coming

Finally done with the day, Sam made her way out of the stadium and across the parking lot to her car. She was just about ready to start up the car and go when she felt another pang from her bladder. It was definitely worse than she had first thought. But to go to the bathrooms she'd have to go all the way back across the parking lot, back into the stadium, and ... it was just too far. It wasn't a long drive home and it's not like she hadn't been in worse situations with her bladder.

On the way home, Sam's thoughts kept wandering back to Mia's desperate rush to the toilet. There was something strangely intriguing about it. Mia seemed almost superhuman: professional athlete, team captain, had the looks of a model. Yet there she was, struggling to keep control of her bladder.

And Sam was in a similar situation herself, still not relived since before the game. Every time she moved her foot on the pedals, she felt the liquid inside of her shift around, a constant reminder of her need. She didnt understand why, but that feeling, along with thinking about Mia's desperation, had her extremely turned on.

The drive home felt twice as long as normal, but she finally made it, running straight to the bathroom. The second she got her panties off, pee starting flowing out of her before she had even sat down on the seat. But Sam didnt really care right now. Her entire body shuddered as she released a powerful stream into the toilet. Peeing had never felt so good. Before she was even done, she was touching herself, getting pee on her fingers and spraying more onto the seat.

She kept going, her clit loving every second of attention until she quickly came. Her body buckled as she enjoyed the release of both her bladder and sexual tension.

After cumming Sam just sat on the toilet for a second, still in a bit of a daze. She had made a mess of her toilet, pee on the seat and on the floor, but for now she just needed to enjoy the moment a little bit longer. And maybe think about Mia desperate for a toilet a little more.
