~Heya~!

It's me, Aim-E, and I'm back.

My plan is to write a, hopefully, substantial story, while also appealing to the audience that I can find here. I'd like to try and improve my own writing, which is why I'm here, to write without too much fear of being laughed at for what I create.

However, while I will try my best, I don't think that this will be for everyone.

I don't plan on holding anything back, writing as I normally would, just with a wet twist on it all.

Updates will likely be pretty slow, so, I hope you don't mind.

If you ever have any comments or anything, feel free to share them.

I'll try my best to look at them frequently, and respond to as many as I can.

Thank you all.

And to everyone interested, please forgive my pace when writing. I unfortunately doubt that I'll be able to punch out a couple chapters a month, so you'll probably get like four updates a year.

Well, I'll do my best.

I hope I can write something people'll enjoy.

Thank you.

Well, I hope people enjoy some (Lots of) violence.

(Also, sorry for not writing this out before I made the post... Whoops? Maybe I shoulda done that?)
