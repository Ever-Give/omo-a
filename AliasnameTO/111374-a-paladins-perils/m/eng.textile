This was inspired by the recent thread about women going in the men's room if theirs was too busy or unavailable for whatever reason:

I think it came out great. Enjoy. 😄

A Paladin’s Perils

For someone whose bedroom was decorated with replica tapestries, shields, and knight figurines he had accumulated since high school, Quinn had yet to live up to the example of his gallant heroes. He started shaking at the first hint of a disagreement, much less a sword fight. So what if he was taller than almost any of his peers. As much as he had learned about fencing and archery, he was too skinny to hold his own there anyway. At least he had won the hearts of many fair maidens– as his group of close female friends, that is, seeing as he was mostly gay. Still, he could not help but feel drawn to the towering figures of Arthur’s Round Table. Something about the chivalrous ideal had impressed itself on Quinn, and the self-identified “soft boy” was certain to see it come out one way or another.

Knights were far from his mind, however, when Amber texted him to invite him to the county fair. It would be the two of them plus Rachel and Michelle. No matter what the activity was, they always had a phenomenal time. It had been awhile since Quinn had been out and was looking for an excuse to get dressed up. A hot pink tank under a mesh t-shirt, ripped skinny jeans, and eyeliner made him feel striking– the kind of guy who would catch his own eye. And it was nice that the girls loved the alt look on him too. Lastly, his fondness for flip-flops might have been out of place with the rest of the style, but he just liked them and hoped they worked.

Seeing as Amber was picking him up, he saw fit to pregame with a few hard ciders, and brought the rest of the six pack for them to share in the parking lot. Drinks inside the fairgrounds were exorbitant. It would likely be an exercise of “one and done” once they got in.

Amber rolled down her car’s window and called out to Quinn as he left his house. “Oh my gawd,” she said, “You look so frigging cute!”

“I know, dahling,” Quinn said, flipping his brown curls while putting on a mid-Atlantic accent. The act didn’t last long, though. He started giggling and thanked her, complimenting her own outfit in turn. She also leaned a bit into the goth look, sporting a striped top, layered black skirt that complimented her dark wavy hair, and ripped stockings inside black boots. The two of them made quite the pair.

Rachel and Michelle met them there. The former had her usual olive fatigue jacket over a black dress and high-heeled boots. The latter dressed more simply, going for a white hoodie with rainbow trim, tiny denim shorts, and hi-top sneakers. A rainbow choker matched the hoodie. It did not matter much what she wore though; everything looked great on her thanks to the fact that she was tall and fit, freckled from head to toe and with blazing red hair. She was one of the few girls Quinn had a legitimate crush on for the entire time he had known her. It was not a secret anymore and the two had moved past it (in part because she was also mostly into girls), but he still got a special thrill every time he got to be with her. The foursome all exchanged hugs and Quinn passed them each a cider.

“So what are we going on first?” he asked, taking a sip of cider. He knew full-well he had used the royal “we.” He was probably the most reluctant of all of them to go on anything scarier than bumper cars. Maybe the liquid courage would help.

“Uhh, whatever’s closest?!” Amber said, her eyes wide. Leave it to her to be the child at heart. Quinn loved her loud, excitable nature; being a quiet one himself, he was thankful to let her have the attention.

Rachel pointed over the venue’s wall. “You can’t go to the fair without going on the big ferris wheel,” she said, getting unanimous agreement. It turned majestically in the distance, its dazzle of flashing lights cutting through the night. “I just hope it won’t have too big a line.”

Quinn nodded in agreement. His bladder gave a nudge already as he imagined dangling in the air. He gave himself a quick press with his palm.

For some reason, he had always been severely shy about his bodily needs. If others suggested one he could go along, but he just did not want to be the one to ask for a potty break. Nobody wanted to know the state of his bodily fluids. Interrupting an activity because he couldn’t hold his pee was just too embarrassing. Things would have to be critical indeed before he spoke up. He knew his friends would be on his side for anything, and voicing the need for a bathroom was not at all unreasonable anyway. Maybe someday he would have that discussion with them, but not right now.

Amber spared him the trouble as they trashed their empty cans while entering. “I just always worry about getting stuck on one of those while having to pee.”

Quinn teased her by wrapping his arms around her from behind and saying, “It’s okay, I’ll be there to remind you of running faucets and waterfalls.” She squirmed out of his grasp and slapped his thigh in retaliation, giggling the whole time. Leave it to her to break the ice on topics he was too afraid to raise.

“Or we’ll take our chances and go without you,” Michelle added, “But it’ll be really lonely on the ground.”

Amber rolled her eyes. “Fine, I’ll go. But if I’m about to pee my pants I’m sitting on whichever of your laps I find first.”

“Deal,” all three of the rest of them said in unison. Amber laughed so hard she screamed. Other people around stared at her. “I might pee my pants right now,” she gasped, putting her hands between her legs. Quinn patted his thighs to beckon her over. Being with the girls really had a way of loosening him up.

The group wandered around a bit, played a few games, and Michelle won a stuffed orca so big she had to take a break to put it in the car. The other three got root beer floats, having one ready for her when she came back.

Quinn had barely noticed that his need to pee had grown pretty strong in the meantime. He was used to holding it until an opportunity came to him; he settled for squeezing his dick under the picnic table they had claimed.

“In all seriousness we probably should find a bathroom,” Rachel said, “I don’t know about you guys but I could definitely go.”

A chorus of “yeahs” and “me toos” followed. Quinn felt the relief already. He’d be fine.

Michelle sighed. “I hate public bathrooms but I guess it’s kind of what we signed up for. Unless I can also use Quinn’s lap.”

Now it was his turn to laugh. Not as hard as Amber, but hard enough to force a drop of pee into his red briefs. “Don’t threaten me with a good time.”

Quinn remained mostly unbothered by the leak. It was not the idea of wetting itself that was unpleasant. He had had leaks as a small child and experimented with pee play more recently, and actually somewhat liked the feeling of pissy clothes on his skin. It made him feel less uptight and more… human, in touch with his human vulnerabilities. Part of why he was so shy about speaking up was that he never felt that someone would like him enough to see his needs and not let them get in the way. It sounded insane even to himself as he went over it in his own mind. The girls were angels, even beating him to the topic this time and including him as if it were their pleasure. Hell, he knew it was. He had settled on identifying as a little crazy and that would have to do.

The four finally found a restroom– a dingy concrete box that they smelled before they saw it. The men’s side maintained steady traffic coming and going. The women’s had a line several people deep out the door.

“That fucking figures,” Rachel said, crossing her legs surely more out of frustration than anything. Amber had her hands on her hips, swaying at the sight as well. Michelle had her hands stuck in her pockets and simply nodded. “If you asked me to imagine a public bathroom, no other prompts whatsoever, this is what I’d imagine. Welcome to my own personal hell.”

“Sorry,” Rachel said, as it was her idea. “At least Quinn can go.”

Quinn waved her off. “I don’t have to go that bad,” he said, hoping they’d pick up on his desire to have solidarity with them. “You guys want to wait in line or walk around and see if it’s better in a little while?”

“I say we keep going,” Michelle said, “I didn’t plan on using the bathroom here anyway.”

“I really wanna go,” Rachel whined, “but it’s so many people in the women’s! It’ll probably be a little while.”

Amber pinched the bridge of her nose. “And I don’t know if it’s the guys’ or girls’ side but it smells fucking horrible here. Not that that will probably be better later but I’m not that desperate yet.”

“Whatever,” Rachel said, “Let’s just come back later.” They were not the only ones to reconsider at the sight of the line and the restroom itself. Others, primarily women, were the ones turning away.

The attractions did not have the same appeal after the failed bathroom attempt. Quinn remained about the same, but the girls were much quieter. The ciders and floats were definitely going through them. The group decided to get in line for the ferris wheel instead if they had to wait for something.

Amber tried to lighten the mood. “You know, I mentioned the having to pee on the ferris wheel thing, but I was not actually expecting it to come true.”

“Offer’s still open,” Quinn said, referencing sitting on his lap.

“Ugh, don’t make me laugh, I’m gonna pee.”

“This is stupid,” Rachel said, rubbing her thighs, “We should just go back now if we want to stay much longer or go home.”

“We’re almost to the front,” Michelle said, standing with her legs crossed, “We can go home right after.”

“What about you, Quinnie?” Amber said, “You said you didn’t have to go that bad but I don’t believe you.”

Quinn blushed. Not only for having to talk about his bladder, but because she wanted to include him. It was not even out of the ordinary, but he still never took it for granted. He loved them all. They deserved to know him. He leaned in close and whispered, “Yeah I actually do have to go really fucking bad.”

Amber creased her brow at him. “You could have gone! You’re a guy, it’s easy for you. We would have waited.”

“I wasn’t gonna make you do that,” he reassured. “Besides, I’m not desperate enough to go in that gross-ass bathroom either."

She sighed dramatically. “Boys are impossible,” she declared, “But at least you get to feel our pain for once.”

They finally got a gondola on the big ferris wheel. The effect was not lost on them that any squirming would be felt by everyone in the suspended carriage. Quinn couldn’t help but chuckling to himself as discreetly as possible as they ascended. Each of the girls seemed to show somehow the way they privately dealt with their struggles– Michelle by crossing her freckled legs, Rachel by wringing her hands, and Amber by openly squeezing her crotch. Quinn kept his hand in his pocket to pinch his dick, although he was certain it fooled no one about what he was doing. With all their talk about having to pee he almost considered letting some out. He would not have minded the wet spot at all; the biggest risk was wanting to do more. However he was still not sure they would react well to suppose even a little that he did it on purpose. For now, he held.

The ride went by very quietly. They had all had enough, not only of having to pee, but of the whole night. It went unsaid that they just needed their own toilets and beds. Although as they approached the bathroom again on the way out, Quinn at least had the chance at relief. For the others, the line had not abated and might have even grown.

“I’m sorry guys, I gotta try going now,” Rachel said, bending over and rubbing her thighs again, “I don’t think I can make it home.”

The other two agreed. Even Michelle didn’t put up a fight. Things must have been bad. Amber physically pushed Quinn towards the men’s. “Quinn, get your ass in there for all of us.”

At that moment, a woman in a hi-vis vest sporting the fairgrounds logo emerged from the women’s side. “I’m sorry for the wait ladies, it looks like half of the stalls in there are clogged. For the next ten minutes we’re going to ask the men to stay out so the women can use their side while we get it serviced. If any men have to use the restroom, this is last call for the next ten minutes!”

Murmurs erupted in the crowd. Some grateful, some less so. “They can’t do that,” some guy said, “What the fuck?” Even some women voiced resistance. “What if a guy stayed back in there?”

A few men entered. “Quinn, go!” Amber urged him again.

“I’d be the last one in,” he said, “I don’t want to make you guys wait for me.”

Before she had a chance to argue further, the other men had left and the employee made the call. Men, you have the porta-potties on the far end for the next ten minutes. Ladies, use the men’s side, thank you.”

Amber simply sighed. The other girls expressed their sympathies as they went in.

Having missed the chance, Quinn’s bladder really began to bear down on him. He leaned against the wall of the restroom, off to the side to be out of the walkway. It was dark and quieter there, leaving him more alone with his urge. Even with his hands in his pockets, he had to really fight back to hold, his muscles trembling against the pressure.

It struck him then what happened just now. Even in a small way, he had sacrificed himself for the good of his friends. He had done a chivalrous deed, and even if it ended with him in wet pants, he could retain his pride. He had no more reasons not to try letting a little out, and may even look better for thinking of others to the bitter end.

He stopped squeezing his dick through his pocket. If he let some pee out now, it would have to go through underwear and two layers of pocket before it showed up on the outside. It was his best chance to do some without embarrassing himself. He breathed deeply and started, ever so gradually, to release his hold.

The line of warmth progressed down his dick. What remained of his control clamped down by instinct. He closed his eyes, inhaled again, and let go, telling himself it was just for a second.

A stream started, much stronger and faster than he expected. He tried to squeeze it off but he was too weak, and the flow too strong. Now he stood barely ten feet away from throngs of people walking by, whimpering quietly and peeing his jeans unfettered.

Heat enveloped his genitals and coated his thigh. The stream completed its course down his leg to drip down his bare foot, slick the sole of his sandal, and start making a puddle in the dirt underneath. He tried to arrange his face so that he looked normal, meanwhile highly doubting it would work. Now he was banking on the idea that strangers would not make a scene for him if they saw.

Rachel emerged to find him first. “Hey, you okay?” she asked. She must not have seen what happened, because only once he turned to her did she say “Oh shit, I’m so sorry!” Michelle emerged next and Rachel tactfully relayed the situation. “Quinn peed his pants.”

Michelle stood with her hands on her hips, looking at the enormous wet spot on his jeans. Finally she nodded. “Sorry, but honestly? Props. I would have done the same if I knew that was the play. Not like we weren’t all thinking it.”

Lastly, Amber. She playfully pounded on his arm. “I even told you to go! Oh my God-uh.”

Rachel came to his defense. “He stayed out so we could go in sooner.” She leaned in to be more discrete for the next part. “And I for one was already leaking a little when I went in so if he didn’t do that, it might have been me. And if I know you well enough, you probably were too.”

She crossed her arms, already knowing she’d been beaten. “I mean, yeah, but… yeah.” She hugged her tall, wet friend. “Sorry, Quinnie, thank you for doing that. You absolutely didn’t have to, but thank you.”

Meanwhile, Quinn was occupied with trying to wring the cooling pee out of his pants. “I mean, that’s kind of the point of doing good things? It’s not as good if you’re forced into it.” He had never imagined he could stand there and have a conversation with his best friends in soaked jeans. “I am sorry about having to sit in your car like this.” The smell was hitting him already.

Amber shrugged. “I’ve got something to put down I think. But yeah, like Rachel said, it was about to be me anyway, I was like really fucking close to losing it.”

Quinn gave a mock courtly bow. “At your service, milady.”

Michelle chimed in, “We knew you were a true knight all along. How about we go and get changed and then a movie at my place?”

Quinn smiled. “I’d like that. As long as I get first dibs on the bathroom.”

I never thought of a scenario quite like this when I made the suggestion for the girls to use the boys bathroom when the girls bathroom was down or had a long line. That’s very interesting.

I figured if it were that crowded, one guy choosing to stay out to give them privacy was pretty unrealistic. The only other possibility is if he were bladder shy around women but that wouldn't lead into the idea that he was doing it as a good deed. 😛
