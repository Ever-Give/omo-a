Times At Aurum: A story about an omo-larp

Hi wet friends 🫶 I recall seeing a proposal at one time for a school-themed LARP, and this idea just took over my brain at work. I had to rush home to start writing it. I intend for it to be a bit of a meandering slice-of-life rather than a tight plot, so if all goes well it will have multiple story arcs. Please let me know if you're interested and I'd be inclined to take suggestions on what scenarios to explore next.

Times At Aurum

I: Commitment

I was usually not in the mood when Caleb messaged me. It meant he was sending me something stupid, something horny, or both. Not that I had a problem with either, honestly, but lately I just hadn’t been in the right mindset. The restaurant where I worked just closed for good. Corporate offered all of us transfers, but the other locations were too far away. I had to take the meager severance and figure shit out.

Caleb was always good to me though, and we got along well when I actually paid him the attention he deserved. I sank into my beat-up couch and looked at my phone.

Bruh you should totally do this

Underneath the message was a link. I tapped it, and up came a site for “Aurum Academy LARP.”

I messaged him back, ?? I’m not really in position to be getting into games right now but I’ll check it out ig

He replied instantly. Dude they pay 200 a day and cover room and board, you might wanna just live there.

I saw dollar signs, but it was probably too good to be true. It could be a pyramid scheme, cult, brothel, or street gang for all I knew. Something… something was the catch. Now I had to figure out what it was.

I skimmed the landing page. It was replete with laurel leaf graphics, shiny gold lettering, and shots of a stately mansion and grounds. “Experience the English boarding school tradition with a golden twist,” the blurb began. So far, all appeared fairly normal for what it claimed to be– a live-action roleplay of a boarding school. Players assumed the role of students and presumably did what the teachers told them? And got paid for it?

It could have been worse I suppose; it was a sex thing. Before I was allowed to continue it made me click through an “18+ only” confirmation. Beyond were pictures of the “students” in old-fashioned uniforms– at times in various states of undress in classroom settings. Many of them sported wet crotches while looking at puddles on the floor, or making guilty faces at a stern teacher figure.

I minimized the page to reply back to Caleb. Looks like an omo larp lol, I’d play it

He knew about that particular interest of mine. I forget when I told him, but it was quite some time ago. I don’t think it ever came up until now. Apparently his pot-addled brain was good for recalling what sexually excited me.

Now he did not just text back; he actually called, starting right in as soon as he knew I answered. “I’m serious dude, it looks like it’s some rich old weirdo or ‘wealthy eccentric’ that runs this place. It’s been going for a couple years now. You said you liked piss stuff, when else would you ever get to do something like this? Unless I totally misread and you’re not that into it. But still, the fuckin’ money!”

He was frustratingly right. I was that into it, but even if not, I could tolerate it for the pay and perks. “I seriously want to, dude, thanks for the recommendation. I don’t know if I’m ready for that though.” It was no lie. I had never been to anything remotely like this. I got nervous whenever the topic of sexuality came up because I was never in the habit of expecting people to accept me.

“It looks like it’s not just teachers spanking you and shit, though, they have actual schedules and activities. Maybe it will be legit.”

“I’ll give it another look,” I said, thoroughly unconvinced.

“That’s all I ask. Love you, dude.” He hung up.

I could only believe I was digging deeper to satisfy my academic curiosity. But the site appeared to corroborate what he said. It involved classes such as diction, theater, and philosophy, as well as plenty of sports and activities: swimming, music, equestrian, fencing, soccer, and perhaps others only hinted at in pictures. At first I was intimidated at the prospect of the sexual theme. Now I was intimidated by the potential rigor of the material.

I kept looking and found some actual policies. They were separated into “Ground Rules” and “School Rules.” The former were listed first, and only included four items.

I: Consent shall be respected by all parties at all times, and may be withdrawn at any time. No exceptions. Okay, that appeared to be a green flag.

II: Roleplay is strongly encouraged everywhere on campus except for marked out-of-game [OG] zones. Acknowledging Rule 1, this includes the expectation of sexual expression. Weirdly phrased, but it made sense in its own way.

III: Players in good standing will receive pay at a daily rate plus performance bonus, determined by player survey and staff discretion. Oh, great. I had to worry about being judged along with doing a sexually-charged classroom wetting game with strangers. But then I supposed that only meant pay went up, rather than down. And it would surely keep things interesting if there were more flamboyant thespians among the players.

IV: The program is intended as an adult recreational experience. Fun is at the core of every part. Relax and enjoy as you see fit. At least they recognized that a school setting can be stressful, to people like me if no others. I would do my best to ‘relax and enjoy’ it.

The “School Rules” underneath were more numerous, and more interesting, as it appeared they were written from a roleplaying perspective themselves.

Foreword: Disciplinary measures are meant to enrich, rather than punish. Receiving discipline is a part of the Aurum Academy experience and is not a mark of poor performance. It is administered at faculty discretion and students are expected to continue their learning with pride.

1: Students shall treat others with respect by refraining from bullying.

2: Students are not to enter the dormitories of the opposite gender at any time.

3: Students shall be present in class at the second bell. Failure to do so will see them considered late.

4: Students shall remain in class for the duration of the lesson except if granted leave from their teacher in the form of a hall pass.

5: Uniforms shall be clean and have all required elements. Classroom supplies are included in this item.

6: Students shall not unduly diminish the order and tidiness of school grounds.

7: Students shall not be excessively loud in inappropriate settings, nor disruptive in class.

8: “Lights-out” at 10pm each night. Students are not permitted out of their bedrooms between lights-out and the opening of the dining hall at 6am.

9: Severe or repeat infractions may be addressed by a visit to the headmaster’s office.

Good grief. This might not be easy money after all. I recalled that my actual school had a similar list of rules and that none seemed unreasonable at the time, but I was also a kid. I had now been an adult for long enough that I did not need some stuck-up bird talking down to me. They emphasized at the top that the whole thing was for fun. How could all that be fun?

But then I reread the foreword. I guess they anticipated some measure of rule-breaking as all part-and-parcel? The wetting was certainly set up by rule 2. It would run afoul of 4, probably 5, and maybe 6. That’s where the unspecified disciplinary measures kicked in I supposed. Whatever; I was willing to give it a try.

My eyes caught on one of the rules again. Even bullying wasn’t that serious? What kind of bullying was acceptable versus grounds for being kicked out? Hopefully it was clear in context and if I played along I would not cross any lines.

No. I had been entertaining signing up for this game for the last hour or so, in a purely intellectual context. It was insane. I was not the type of person to go to sex parties, especially not long-term events where I would be literally sleeping next to the type of people who went to sex parties. But the money was necessary, and the pants-wetting element had me stirring.

Caleb texted again. So what do you think?

I think you’re fucked in the head, I replied. But I’m flattered that you remembered I like pee stuff.

U don’t want to go?

I sighed, putting my choice in writing. No, it’s just too far out of my comfort zone. Sorry.

How about I go with you?

My eyes widened. You serious?

Dead fucking serious. The money would be nice and I wanna see if I can see what you see, if you know what I mean. And it’s not real school, we can bring our own car and if it’s too weird we just leave.

He was right about that. Consent could be withdrawn at any time, no exceptions. He had finally sold me.

Fine, I sent. I can’t believe I’m doing this.

Fuck yea bro, I’m excited. See u at the start of term lol.

I tossed my head back as I reclined. What in the world was I getting myself into? At least Caleb would be there. Hell, maybe he would be more into it than I was and I’d be the nervous wallflower all by myself. Also, I had never done anything remotely sexual with Caleb when it was just the two of us. How comfortable would either of us be if things started happening in a group setting? I guess we were about to find out. I filled out the application form and clicked to confirm it. Then confirmed again through email. It was happening. I had enrolled in Aurum Academy of Poise and Propriety, with orientation coming up soon.

Mostly an expository chapter here, sorry about a bare minimum of omo content. But I promised a slow story and that's what it's gonna be 😛

II: Admission

The morning of orientation arrived. I picked up Caleb, being more comfortable with driving since he kicked in some money for the gas. We headed out to the foothills of the White Mountains, where Aurum was supposedly cloistered away. To the credit of the builders, the dense forest all around did help clear the mind. Were it an actual school I would look forward to seeing it in the fall.

There must not have been enough parking on the campus proper, as a line of cones directed incoming traffic to a grassy field. But just ahead stood a tall wall and wrought iron gate, flanked by topiary hedges. The gate was cracked open so that we could walk through. I popped the trunk and we both hauled out our luggage. The “what to know before you go” page was clear we would be given uniforms today, but we both brought clothes just in case. Other people entering had the same idea. To see others as nervous and over-prepared was comforting.

I put on a brave face for Caleb while approaching, but my heart was pounding. This was not a school, I told myself, not for reassurance but as a warning. It’s an omorashi venue and sex den. But as I had taken to telling myself, if something both scares and excites you, you should probably do it. Signing up for Aurum beyond fit the bill. “This is it, bro,” I told Caleb, before we passed through the gate, “We’re gonna be students.”

“This is your arena,” he said through a nervous grin, “I’m just here to make sure you do it.”

“What! You said you want to see what I see with the omorashi stuff.”

“Well yeah, that too, but if only one of us was going to do it, it would have to be you.”

I clapped him on the back. “I hate how right you are.”

He reassured me again as we passed rows of more immaculate landscaping, “I think it’ll be fun.”

I don’t know what I expected the school to look like. Somehow, the fact that it looked identical to the promotional material, down to the arched windows and soaring pinnacles above, still came as a surprise. How could anyone have tucked away an opulent English country estate this close to home? And not even as a free event, but a paying one? All we had to do in return was play around and maybe wet ourselves once in awhile. Maybe that was more a deal-breaker for others than Caleb and me.

An old man in a flat cap who introduced himself as the caretaker was leaning against one of the open doors at the entrance, beckoning us inside. Not much chatting went on among the would-be students. Even those extroverted among us could not yet break the ice. We had little idea how we would be interacting with each other once the game started. At least the majority of players were cute.

Finally, a woman came to the top of the double staircase flanking the foyer. She was likely in her forties, with a tight black bun. Her tweed pencil-skirt suit and black pumps were the image of one immersed in academia. Completing the look was a clipboard in her left hand. “Good morning everyone,” she enunciated while descending slowly, in an accent so posh she may have been the late Queen’s speech therapist. It would almost have been comical if not all too appropriate. The last remnants of murmuring in the small crowd died down. “And thank you for your promptness; we shall handle any latecomers as the need arises. I am Professor Jane Primrose, the assistant headmaster here at Aurum. Surely the headmaster himself would prefer to be the first to welcome you, but I’m afraid he’s away on holiday at the moment. We shall press on.”

Orientation proceeded. It was so methodical as to be almost disappointing. We were directed to the registrar’s office to check in, dropped off our bags in our assigned rooms, and started on a tour of the grounds. Granted every inch was breathtaking. Every flattering angle of the website’s photos failed to do justice to the beauty of the campus. Stone cladding, chandeliers, dark wood panels, gilt-frame paintings of historical figures past. Green fields and a lake beyond. We may as well have been transported to a bucolic moor in old England rather than new. When Caleb had said “wealthy eccentric” I strained to imagine who might have the wealth to own and operate this place at a heavy loss.

“Now,” Professor Primrose announced as she ushered us into the small amphitheater outside the south wing, “the question-and-answer period. We understand that Aurum Academy is a highly… unconventional school. Hopefully I can assuage any questions you may have before the start of term proper tomorrow.”

A girl with shiny black hair and a bubbly attitude was called on first. After the pleasure of hearing the professor’s crisp pronunciation, the girl’s rapid American accent clashed.“I know this whole thing is kind of about peeing ourselves, but will we like, have to have to? Or is it something that just happens?”

The professor grinned. “A fair question. What’s your name, miss?”

“Kelcey.”

“A pleasure to meet you, Miss Kelcey. That is something of a complex question, I’m afraid. The rigors of the classroom setting are sometimes too much for students’ developing abilities. Other times they are, in a sense, told to. But of course consent is respected at all times.”

It was nice to know that other people were already anxious about how the pee stuff would go. Everything seemed to make sense so far. Most of the other questions safely fell under “having not read the material given to us” and I was able to tune it out. Being both this scared and this excited was a strange feeling. I just wanted to start the game for real.

Before we were given the evening (for “tea” in the dining hall) we had uniform fitting. There was a huge storehouse by the groundskeepers’ buildings full of white shirts, tweed coats, trousers, knee pants, and skirts. Some other accessories I spotted were flat caps, dress shoes, and ties in the school colors of black and gold. I wished I had brought another suitcase to take all these items back up to the house. At least each of us had an armoire to ourselves in the shared bedrooms.

At tea we got to meet some of the “upper classmen.” These were players who had played the game before and came to mingle with us in full uniform. They added even more to the immersive feel of the school. One could tell a student’s seniority by the golden “A” lapel pins. One bar underneath denoted a “year ten” for someone who had played once before. Two bars for a “year eleven” and any longer repeat players had three for “year twelves.” One boy and one girl also wore golden “P” insignias on the other lapel. They were the prefects. I wondered if we would have to follow their commands as well if we saw them.

I began to suffer a bit of sensory overload by this point. The good food and events of the day had any more information reach me as a blur. All I remembered was that we would do well to wake early so we would have time to get ready before our first class the next morning, which started at 9am sharp. I was thankful to have the bottom bunk, letting Caleb take the top. Although I was very tired, I still had considerable trouble finally falling asleep. And then, all I seemed to dream of was grey woolen fabric, dripping wet.

III: First Taste

A cacophony of cell phones went off the next morning at 7am. Someone recommended we turn them off and put them away, like good students.

I actually did not immediately recall how we were supposed to manage having so many people trying to prepare ourselves for the day all in the same place. Then I remembered we were shown the bathrooms. They were an exercise in body confidence for sure. Although the toilets themselves were in stalls, the showers were a row of open nozzles at the end of exposed pipes on the walls. Caleb and I exchanged looks and quietly cursed in unison. It was essentially a sex club, after all. We had better get really friendly with our classmates in short order.

The other first-year students in our room also seemed all in their twenties. Will was a stoutly-built blond, Richie was tall and reedy with a bouncy dark brown mop, Bashir was ethnic Nigerian with designs shaved into his buzz cut, and Aaron was short with auburn hair simply styled. Having all introduced ourselves, it was slightly less uncomfortable all showering in the open together. Despite at least trying to make the appearance of looking away, I couldn’t help myself from glancing. Caleb and I had never seen each other naked until now. I had never wanted to limit myself with a sexuality label, so felt safe admitting that he was cute. It was just as well; who knew what would happen, and with whom?

Someone jumped right in during the showers. While we all lathered with our eyes locked downward, a broad patch of yellow snaked from the tiled floor to the drain. I did not notice who was brave enough to let it out. Although I did it all the time at home and was almost squeezing my thighs together for having to go so badly now, I was too shy to do it myself. I toweled off and dressed before I got too obvious an erection, just knowing someone had peed on the shower floor in front of everyone. I almost considered holding my own pee longer still, but used the urinal. There would surely be plenty of chances to refill.

Putting the uniform on went a long way towards fostering a sense of inclusion. Not a moment after tightening the tie did I feel like a student already.

There was a breakfast spread on the buffet tables in the dining hall. We helped ourselves to the beverages especially. Water, coffee, tea, and fruit juices flowed liberally. The physical handbook clarified some of what the online rules did not, including the school’s demerit system. Finishing a full cup while observed by a staff member was considered to counteract one demerit point, as well as prevent one that had not yet been levied. Plus, there was an ongoing informal contest between the year levels about who could drink the most over the week-long term. Other than that, breakfast was a more subdued meal than last evening’s, as it was still fairly early and a bit chilly in the cavernous room.

Professor Primrose assumed the podium on the far end, with the rest of the faculty behind her as the last of the students filtered in. “Good morning,” she began, “I hope our new students have found the accommodations suitable. Welcome again to Aurum. For our upperclassmen, welcome back. At the first bell in approximately one hour, the term shall be considered officially begun. It is the utmost pleasure of the entire staff to serve you all for the days to follow. Good luck, have fun, and as the motto of the school advises, Doctrina et amor idem: ‘Teaching and love are the same.’”

The teachers departed to polite applause. I double-checked the schedule I received the day prior. The first class of the day was Handwriting, in room 22 with Professor Primrose herself. “Prim” as the upperclassmen referred to her amongst themselves.

“Dude, we got Prim,” Caleb said, jumping right in, “We better be on our best behavior unless we wanna get disciplined.”

“I guess so,” I said, nervously chuckling a bit, “But if you want to act out I’ll watch. That reminds me we should get our pencils and notebooks just in case.”

Breakfast had wound down by the time the distant clanging of the bell tower signaled class time. Having made a stop in the dormitory before trying to find room 22 in the sprawling campus, amid a throng of other uniformed people trying to find their respective rooms, was surreal.

Not a moment had passed before we were reminded the game had properly started. The male prefect had stopped someone in the hall with a vape. “Expect to hear from Professor Royce” is all I caught from the exchange. The guilty student was grinning abashedly but did indeed hand it over. The prefect escorted him to the nearest water fountain to take his drink.

Room 22 was upstairs in the main house, first door on the left. It was decorated in a similar manner to the rest of the campus, with old-fashioned wooden desks and chairs, and a chalkboard in the front. The professor entered shortly before the bell rang a second time.

She paced before her own desk, with her hands clasped behind her back, and raised her eyebrows. “No Johnny-come-latelies, very impressive.”

We all sat, stone quiet.

Prim continued. “Welcome to Handwriting, and for those first years, again to Aurum at large. Before getting right down to it, I should reiterate one critical school policy: that of the bronze pass.” She pointed to a hook on the wall near the door, from which dangled a handful of bronze medallions on burgundy ribbons. “As we have stated already, consent is respected at all times. If one needs to withdraw consent in an immediate and game-breaking fashion, that is acceptable. For other cases where students desire to maintain immersion while stepping back from certain conceits, there is the bronze pass. You may ask for one whenever you wish for gentler disengagement, with intent to resume full duties shortly. If another staff member or myself interprets a student’s undue discomfort, we may recommend the use of the bronze pass, or you may request it yourself. Are there any questions regarding it now?”

There were none. Satisfied, she clapped her hands and proceeded.

“Excellent. We’ll begin with attendance. Do I have any upperclassmen among us for volunteers?”

A girl with her hair done in a similar neat black bun, and two bars on her lapel pin, raised her hand.

“I knew I could count on you, Miss Ortega,” Prim said, smiling.

“Teacher’s pet,” another third year boy called out. He bore a strong resemblance to the girl he was teasing.

“Mister Ortega,” Prim admonished, “It is first thing in the morning.” I found myself grinning. The rapport between veteran educator and well-meaning mischievous brother was somehow sweet.

Miss Ortega began calling names. The students responded “here” or “present” in turn. Something told me attendance was an opportunity for acting out we were expected to take advantage of. It was likely everyone was too nervous to try making a scene right away. Plus, it was still early. The ritual ended without a hitch, allowing Prim to start teaching.

She took a piece of chalk and began writing a sentence on the board. The chalk clacked as she scrawled “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” in disconnected, disproportionate strikes. She repeated the sentence underneath, this time in a flourished cursive.

“Handwriting has suffered from decreased priority among many as of late, but is not without its merits even into the modern age. If you entered a classroom and the teacher wrote on the board, which style would elicit a greater sense of respectability?”

Caleb raised his hand and was called on. “Honestly it wouldn’t really matter to me, because if someone has messy handwriting that maybe just means they think fast and care about the content rather than the presentation.”

Prim pursed her lips. “It was a rhetorical question, Mister…” she referred to the seating chart, “...Garner. I’ll keep an eye on you.” He crossed his arms and leaned back, satisfied with himself. “Now if I could have everyone please copy in your notebooks the sentences I’ve written here, first in a careless style and again taking greater care for form.”

We all pulled out our pencils and notebooks to begin the assignment. Out of the corner of my eye I spotted the first-year girl next to me swallow. She tapped my arm and mouthed, “Can I borrow a pencil?”

I turned to my bag to get another one, but Prim approached. “What was it you wanted to share, Miss… Lauren Hazelwood?”

Her eyes grew round looking up at Prim’s looming presence. “Nothing.”

“Nothing, ma’am,” Prim corrected her. Now all eyes were on them.

“Nothing, ma’am,” the girl mumbled, staring intently at her white page.

“Are you sure? Your notebook, while certainly a fine specimen, looks decidedly blank. Would you start the assignment please?”

Lauren swallowed again. “I just need to borrow a pencil, ma’am.”

The professor huffed. “School policy dictates that students arrive in class prepared. And the prohibition against lying to one’s teacher should go without codification.” She fetched a pencil from her desk drawer and handed it to the girl. “See me in my office after class.”

I don’t know what came over me. I must have been feeling the energy of a strict teacher and scared student a bit too strongly, because I blurted out “Oooh” in a rising tone. Just because Lauren was in deep shit.

The professor referred to the seating chart again. “Gregory Haddon, you too.” She was talking to me. Now the whole class started a commotion, but it took one look from Prim to quiet them down again to work on the assignment.

My heart was definitely pumping now. My “good” handwriting sentence was scarcely better than the bad one for my nerves.

The class proceeded. None of the first years dared to make a scene afterward, but the upperclassmen knew the song and dance already. While we wrote individual letters and other sentences in the neat style, the Ortega brother had busied himself by tearing bits of paper, sucking them into spitballs, and flicking them at people.

The professor did not even look up from her desk. “Thank you, Mister Ortega, for volunteering to help the caretaker tidy the classroom during study hall, and for taking the solo during choir. And that will cost you one cup of water per spitball.”

Ortega covered his mouth to suppress his laughter. “I’m sorry, ma’am,” he said, going to her desk. She pulled a gallon jug of water from underneath and began portioning out his drinks.

“This behavior is a fine example for our first years,” he said, watching as he drank. It struck me that in reality, she was not being sarcastic. He was literally a good example for us. If I had not already landed myself in trouble I would have to come up with something similar to participate more actively.

The bell tolled. The students collected their things and filed out. Meanwhile, the professor curled a finger for Lauren and me. We two scared students exchanged looks and followed her.

Finally I get a little spice going in this chapter. 😄

IV: Prim’s Office

Her office was downstairs, right off the foyer. She ushered us inside and closed the door. It was dark, all wood panels and lit only by a dim chandelier overhead.

“Have a seat, Mr. Haddon,” she said, pointing to a chair off to the side. “I’ll deal with you in a moment.” Lauren stayed standing.

The professor claimed the chair behind the desk and rested her elbows on top of it, clasping her fingers. “Before the modern age of writing instruments,” she started lecturing Lauren, “scribes still had options. Primarily they had stone styli much like chalk, charcoal pencils, and most fashionably, quills.” Prim withdrew a wispy feather from her top drawer. "Are you familiar, Miss Hazelwood, with how they work?”

Lauren shifted before her, one hand gripping the other behind her back. “I think so, ma’am.”

The professor elaborated regardless, turning and stroking the feather as she spoke. “A properly-crafted quill, filled with ink, releases it in a controlled fashion upon careful pressure.” She put the feather down. “Take off your coat. You may hang it on the hook by the door.”

Lauren did so, placing the coat on the hook beside me.

“And now your shirt.”

“Sorry, Professor?”

Prim’s nostrils flared. “Miss Hazelwood, you are a gifted English student and I spoke clearly. I will not ask again.”

Lauren gulped a third time. “Yes, ma’am.” She blushed when glancing over at me, but loosened her tie before slipping it over her head, draping it with her coat. The professor watched intently as trembling hands opened her buttons, one by one, and Lauren shrugged her shoulders free of the blouse. Her skin looked soft, and she carried just enough weight to give her folds above her hips and an inviting muffin top. She kept her lips parted and her arms crossed. Her full breasts rose and fell in her grey bra as she tried to keep her breathing under control.

Prim gestured that she place it with the rest of her clothes. “Good,” she said, as she emerged from behind the desk, retrieving the feather again. “Against the wall, please, facing me, and arms over your head.”

Lauren did as she was told. Her armpits had patches of dark stubble, and as the light played across her body, the faintest mist of sweat clung in the creases there.

The professor stood face to face with the girl, guiding Lauren’s arms until her wrists were together, and with one hand, pinned them to the wall. Lauren gasped. Goosebumps had risen all over her.

Meanwhile I had gone solidly hard, gorging myself on the scene. My dick was extending down my pant leg, its outline likely visible if either of them looked my way. I had to be extremely obvious in adjusting it. Remembering again this was all for fun, I overcame my shyness a bit and started rubbing it through the fabric.

Prim breathed to her captive student, “Would you ask for a bronze pass, Miss Hazelwood? You’re trembling.”

Lauren shook her head. “No, ma’am. It’s just cold.”

“Remember about the quill?” the professor said, holding it up with her free hand, “It responds to adequate… pressure.”

She began drawing the feather across Lauren’s skin, starting on her neck and collarbone, moving across to her upper arm and armpits, and over her midriff. Lauren writhed and cried out laughing the whole time until the professor stopped.

“Hmm,” Prim said, holding the feather under her nose and inhaling, “It appears my technique was inadequate. I will have to try again.”

She drove the feather back into Lauren’s skin, drawing little circles. Lauren squealed again and twisted left and right against the tickling. Tears glinted in the outside corners of her eyes. “Please, ma’am!” she whimpered in between gasps. “I’m sorry I forgot my pencil and lied to you.”

“This is not for my satisfaction, Miss Hazelwood,” the professor asserted, “This is to demonstrate that if one method of writing fails, there are others.”

“I don’t understand.” She continued to squirm under the professor’s grasp.

“Inquisitive child, tell me,” Prim purred, drawing closer and brushing Lauren’s cheek with her fingers, “When was the last time you used the toilet?”

Lauren’s eyes flicked about while searching for the answer. “Before breakfast.”

“So your inkwell should be suitably full by now. Your assignment was to write.”

She traced the feather across Lauren’s body a third time. The girl still twisted and squealed. “But ma’am!” she cried, as understanding developed, “Your floor!”

Prim’s treatment with the feather did not relent. “I gave you an instruction. My floor is none of your concern.”

Under Lauren’s commotion, the sound of liquid pattering erratically on hardwood swelled. She was peeing. Some of her stream was falling straight between her legs, making a puddle and yellow sparkles on the leather of her Mary Janes. The way she wriggled had more pee tracing trails past her knees, turning her tall socks dark and shiny where they soaked it in.

Prim withdrew the feather and let Lauren’s arms go. Lauren stood with her eyes closed and feet apart, panting as the dwindling stream ran out of her.

The professor returned the feather to her desk and touched Lauren’s arm, brushing her thumb over the skin affectionately. “I hope you’ve learned your lesson.”

Lauren smiled, beginning to catch her breath. “Yes, ma’am.”

“I’m glad to hear it, but we are not quite done.” She gathered the material of Lauren’s skirt between her legs and pressed it against her soaked underwear, wringing and rubbing the fabric together until the moisture came through. “The truth of the matter is that you have gotten wee all over your clothes. Now you will be discouraged from lying about it.”

Lauren blushed again. She had not been expecting that. “Yes, ma’am,” she dutifully added.

“Good girl. You may dress, and if you’d please have a seat next to Mister Haddon. He was privy to your punishment, and now you may either go back to class or stay for his.”

Lauren made eye contact with me, cracking a grin. “I’ll stay, ma’am, thank you.” She retrieved her clothes and took her seat.

Prim looked at me now. “Your turn, Mister Haddon. Come here.”

I rose, attempting not to show the severity of my erection. By the way Prim looked at my crotch, I had most likely failed.

“The thing about malicious classroom teasing,” she began, having returned to her own chair as well, “Is that the one doing the teasing is afraid. Afraid of one’s fragile status amongst their peers crumbling, and teasing is an effort to shore it up. Was that what happened when I addressed Miss Hazelwood’s infraction earlier?”

Damn. This game was bordering on therapy. “I might have been a bit afraid of that, yes ma’am.” I never spared a thought for what I’d confess to being afraid of before this point.

She continued. “Fear for social status is a fear of emotional vulnerability. You worry that your peers will not like you if they see the real you. But in this school, and among all who share mutual love and respect, vulnerability is not weakness. Vulnerability is honesty. And as I hope to instill in Miss Hazelwood here, honesty is a virtue. Instead of teasing someone else in her moment of vulnerability, we will share with her one of our own."

“...I don’t know what you mean, ma’am.” I hesitated to expect that she would make me go through the same treatment as Lauren.

“You felt something else when seeing Miss Hazelwood’s corrective action, I presume. Arousal?”

My heart jumped to my chest. Under normal circumstances it would be the astronomically distant opposite of appropriate to tell the truth here. But I did. “Yes, ma’am.”

“And you fear that because arousal is not always acceptable, you might feel it at inconvenient times, much less express it. Well, Mr. Haddon, now is your chance to experience this vulnerability by expressing it. Open your trousers.”

Heat blasted my face. With the professor and Lauren watching, I unbuckled my belt, opened my button, and unzipped the fly. The uniform did include plain white briefs, which I dutifully wore, and which my dick was straining against.

The professor slipped around her desk like she had for Lauren. “Pull them down a bit further. The pants too.”

I did so, but was confused for a moment. “Your underwear,” Lauren chimed in, reminding me the professor used a UK dialect.

Here goes. I hooked my thumbs in the waistband and pulled everything down, letting my stiff member spring out.

Prim inhaled noisily again, taking in the sight. “Yes, women weeing and touching intimately does get you a bit riled up, doesn’t it?” She approached and cupped my dick in her hand. It had softened somewhat during her mini-lecture but sprang back to life at her fingertips.

“Yes ma’am,” I breathed, flexing my groin.

“Please take a seat, right there on the desk if you will.”

I did as I was told. She went back around to the other side, directly behind me. “Make yourself comfortable,” the professor said, her mouth right next to my ear, “Lean back into me if you prefer.”

She took hold of my dick and started slowly rubbing it, cooing in my ear to give me my own goosebumps. “You may use your own hand too if you please, but I want you to recall the way I corrected Miss Hazelwood. The way I had her remove her shirt, tickled her with the feather and made her squirm, smelled her scent. The way she went in her clothes, down her legs, all the way until she was empty.”

It was around this time I noticed the smell of Lauren’s fresh pee having diffused through the room. I locked eyes with Lauren. She was breathing heavily again, with the front of her skirt hitched up and her hand working inside her yellowed panties.

Prim asked, “Did it excite you?”

“Yes,” I panted, leaning my head into her and brushing her fingers with mine when working my dick, “It was amazing.”

“Show me.”

I closed my eyes and went over the scene again. Sometimes focusing on the same details, sometimes others. In seconds I felt a rumbling deep within.

Prim must have felt that I was close. She grabbed the open fly of my trousers and wrapped it around the head of my dick. “Let it all out.”

“Yes ma’am.” I knew I was about to cum ferociously into my uniform, but in the moment, cared less about that than heeding her command. Lauren might have been climaxing before me. With her soft moans in the background, I writhed in Prim’s embrace and grunted, letting it rip. The cum made an audible squirt as it flew from my dick. Like Lauren’s pee had done to her skirt, the fabric instantly darkened. My chest heaved as I recovered from the orgasm, squeezing the last of the sperm into my briefs.

The professor disentangled herself from me and squeezed my shoulder. “Now there should be no question that you found Miss Hazelwood’s predicament to be intensely attractive. To the point where you likewise indisposed yourself, yes?”

“Yes, ma’am,” I said, still propped on my elbows hanging awkwardly off her desk, with my leaking, deflating dick in Lauren’s full view.

“Then you have nothing left to tease her about?”

I looked to Lauren. She was still in the process of flattening her damp skirt, her own breathing still heavy after getting off to my punishment. “No, ma’am.”

“There’s a good lad. You may dress, and both of you get back to class.”

Lauren waited while I put myself back together. The cum stain near my pocket was unmistakable; my only hope was that my coat covered it from certain angles. She grabbed my arm as we exited Prim’s office. “That was so fucking hot, I hope you didn’t mind my pee or that I got off to you.”

“No, I honestly loved it,” I said, grinning. “I hope you didn’t mind me getting off to you.”

“Haha clearly not,” she answered, squeezing my arm a little tighter, “I hope we have more classes together. And maybe more punishments.”

“We’ll just have to keep making trouble then.”

V: Math Problems

Checking our schedules again, Lauren and I had different classes for second period. She went to Diction, and I went to Mathematics. We traded smiles and goodbyes upon parting ways.

The math “professor” at the board was most likely younger than I was. He must hardly have been out of actual high school, someone I could have tutored. But he had sharp eyes, was dressed immaculately in a three-piece suit, and with a hand in his pocket, commanded the classroom.

He looked me up and down before checking his attendance sheet. “Mister Haddon, nice of you to grace us with your presence. Where have you been?” He glanced again at my seed-damp crotch.

“I was in Prim’s– I mean, Professor Primrose’s office. Sir. She was disciplining us.”

“And who is ‘us’?”

Part of me thrilled at feeling these kinds of nerves again. Even the elements of Aurum that were not strictly sexual were a wild experience. The professor had me quivering in my Oxfords as someone likely not even allowed to drink. “Lauren Hazelwood and I, sir. We both acted out in her class.”

Caleb had been sitting in the back row. He fake-coughed to sneak in, “Snitch!”

“Watch yourself, Mister Greer,” the professor said, pointing at him, “Lest you be next. There is no honor among thieves nor troublemakers.”

“Sorry, sir,” Caleb said, slinking down in his desk.

“Now, where were we? I am Professor Royce. Mister Haddon, one cup of water for being late, and another for your stained trousers. Hopefully you can control your hormonal urges a bit better from now on.” The class giggled in response.

He produced a similar gallon jug from under his desk and poured my cups. It was not fair to make me drink either of them, as both infractions were due to another punishment. But I knew better than to try making a fuss. I wiped my mouth and sat down.

On my desk was a worksheet titled “Initial Assessment”. It was covered with math problems, ranging from simple addition up to simple algebra. Being a good math student in real life, I started cruising through them.

I only noticed the Ortega brother from before was sitting right beside me because he raised his hand. “May I go to the bathroom, sir?” he asked.

The professor looked over the rim of his glasses at the boy. “Are you done with your worksheet?”

“No, sir, but I can’t really concentrate on it.”

“And why would that be?”

“Because,” he said, leaning forward and kneading his crotch with both hands. His voice cracked and began faltering on the second part. “I really have to go.” He held his lips pressed together and eyes on the professor, pleading.

Royce was unmoved. “A little birdie told me you were being disruptive in Professor Primrose’s class. Is that true?”

“Y-yes, sir, but it’s kind of an emergency.” The way he moved suggested he was telling the truth.

“I will decide what constitutes an emergency in my own classroom. Either wait until study hall or complete your assignment first, and it’s another cup of water for every point off so make sure you do your best.”

He whined in disappointment. In a move out of character for me, I leaned over to encourage him. I whispered, “Study hall is really soon, you can make it.”

“I hope so, bro,” he said, wincing and continuing to squeeze his crotch with his free hand, “Prim made me drink so much.” He did have multiple cups of water last period, enough that I lost count. I had just cum and already started stirring again, thinking of how strong his urge must be. He made eye contact for a moment. For a troublemaker, he was extremely cute. Being about to pee his pants only turned up his attractiveness that much more. “Name’s Marco.”

“Greg.”

“Eyes on your own paper, Mister Haddon,” Royce warned, “And you too, Mister Ortega. Socialize after class unless you both want zeroes.”

I finished quickly and delivered my paper to the front. At least now I’d have a better chance to pay full attention to Marco’s struggle. He had begun bouncing his leg off and on, and looking at the clock more frequently. In the last few minutes of glass, his breathing had gotten ragged, and he spent half the time with his pencil down, eyes crushed shut, and both hands between his legs. Shyer students might have wet themselves by now by trying not to make a scene. Cute and popular Marco, however, was determined to go the distance.

The bell tolled. Study hall. Marco left his paper on his desk. He dodged the students standing up and hobbled out the door to a chorus of giggles. I did him the kindness of collecting his assignment for him and started to follow.

His groan echoed through the hall long before I saw him. I thought for sure he was peeing himself. Upon catching up to him though, he was standing outside the boys’ room with his legs twisted together. A few other students stood with him, but he was by far in the worst shape. The prefect had a keyring in hand, having just finished locking the door.

“What the fuck, bro?” Marco said, his face a mask of pain.

“I’ll let the language slide,” the prefect said, “But someone reported smelling vape in the bathroom. It will stay closed until the culprit is found.”

“I bet I know who did it,” Marco said, “That first-year you caught this morning. Just let me in, bro, you know it wasn’t me. Please.”

“If I let you in, I’ll have to let everyone in, and then I’d get in trouble. So you’re just going to have to wait.”

The crowd had formed something of a circle around Marco, not only to watch what was about to happen, but to avoid the splash. He swallowed and exhaled. Although he had already been leaking as evidenced by the darkness of the fabric visible when he shifted his grip on himself, he had just fully lost it. His right thigh started growing shiny and dark, with some of the stream coming straight through and running down the outside of his pant leg. He stood with his legs still crossed, continuing to pee, his growing puddle starting to creep towards the wall. Some students around pointed and laughed, mostly those who had suffered his spitballs just prior. Others offered their sympathy. I had started squeezing my crotch in turn, half because I also had to go and half because I was getting turned on all over again.

Prim’s high heels started clacking in the distance, parting the crowd without her saying a word.

“What on Earth is all this?” she asked the prefect, her eyes darting between him and the sodden Marco.

“I locked the bathroom as you said, ma’am. Marco started relieving himself right in front of me.”

“Mister Ortega,” she said, her eyebrows raised, “Is this true?”

Unbelievably, he started grinning, squeezing pee out of his dripping trousers. “Well, yes ma’am, but I didn’t do it on purpose. I had to go all last period and Professor Royce wouldn’t let me.”

He looked too cute and scared for me to stay silent. I spoke up in his defense. “It’s true, ma’am. He asked to go and was denied. Please let him off with a warning.”

Prim’s mouth worked in forming a judgment. She turned to the prefect. “I did just instruct Mister Haddon here on the nature of vulnerability. It appears he has learned a thing or two. Escort Mister Ortega to the nurse.”

The prefect nodded and beckoned Marco away. Prim looked at me and cracked a grin. “That was an admirable thing you did for your classmate. Keep up the good work.”

“Thank you, ma’am,” I said. We parted ways.
