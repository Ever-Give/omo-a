If you’ve ever played a game called “The legend of Zelda, breath of the wild” you may have noticed that Zelda held Ganon for 100 years. Which gives me an idea. How did Zelda use the bathroom while she was holding Ganon?

Well, the power that Zelda was using to hold in Ganon also held in on her bladder, apparently. Which meant she was not only holding in Ganon for 100 years, she was also holding an immersive flood of pee

She was always screaming “I can’t hold it much longer”, and when link freed her just in time, in between that and the ending cutscene, Zelda had the biggest pee ever.

She didn’t even bother to find a toilet, she had to do it so bad, she just let it out with her dress on, standing up and all, and didn’t care where it landed. She felt nothing but relief and pure bliss for the next 20 minutes, and was stared at by everyone, but she didn’t care. All she cared about was that she could let a hundred years worth of pee out.
