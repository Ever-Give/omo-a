AnonymousHCV's model of the world: It is 2100. Scientists have conducted several new research on human bodily functions as they feel humans wasted a lot of time for excretion. They eventually created a chemical which would change the world and make people more production! It would pass genetically so the future was productive. Humans no longer need to defecate. Their food's nutrients are absorbed and the rest is directly converted into urine. This chemical caused a 400% increase in female bedwetting/incontinence cases while causing the males to be arrogant and reckless.

In China due to rise of feminism, male torture is legal and eventually all males of the world are eradicated. Scientists replicated chemical which would cause one of the females during their own gender intercourse to become pregnant. Crime rates has decreased by 70% while lesbianship is massively supported. Another chemical was also created to prevent having any male children. All data about the existence of human male was destroyed.
