Hello! Nice to meet y'all. I've been a lurker around here for many years, posting on the very rare occasion but not really getting too involved. I haven't written erotica in well over a decade at this point, but a few omorashi scenarios passed by me that I couldn't let go of‚Äîso I suppose I have, quite unwittingly, started writing some serial fiction! No promises on update schedule, or whether we'll get to see Sacchi and Em ever get to T≈çky≈ç. Nonetheless, I hope you enjoy this work!

Happy to hear feedback in the comments, but please note that I do not read PMs. Don't be creepy üòú

Content notes: While omorashi and omutsu are central themes of this story, also expect making out, intimate touching and fingering, toilet peeing, bladder control, pleasure control, nakedness, and lesbian sex (they're on vacation, what do you expect the "surprise" is at the end of the journey? =P ).

A brief reminder that this is a work of fiction. A lot of what happens in this story occurs in public‚Äîit rides the line between keeping things private and consensual and property free of pee, and involving nearby strangers without their consent. While this is fine in fiction, where characters exist merely in the imagination, this story should in no way be taken as encouraging similar activities in real life‚Äîplease be mindful of the consent of everyone who might knowingly or unknowingly become party to your sexual acts before taking part in them!

Chapter 1

"To new adventures!"

"Kampa-a-a-ai!"

The two girls clinked their glasses of orange juice together and drained them. A sleepy woman sitting at the table behind them started in surprise; her cup of morning coffee rattled on the wooden tabletop.

Maybe a caf√© at six in the morning was an odd time for toasts and festivities. But the two of them had a very exciting flight to catch this morning, and they had to make sure they were pumped and ready.

They dropped their glasses onto their serving tray. Sachiko flipped her straight black hair over her shoulder, set her elbows in front of her and looked into her friend's hazel eyes. She smirked. "So, Em, did you remember to wear your...?"

"Yup! Wouldn't want any accidents, would we?" Emily giggled. "You got yours?"

"Of course," said Sachiko. She slid her phone out of her bag and glanced at the clock, then took out a metal water bottle, swinging it on her finger by the carabiner. "Okay, we have 20 minutes before we have to go. Shall we share another drink?"

"Definitely! Me first." In a flash of orange, white and pink fingernails, the water bottle was gone from Sachiko's hand.

"Hey, Em! Save some for me!"

~***~

"Sacchi-i-i-i." Em pressed her backpack into her crotch.

"Oh my God, Em. Already?"

Em nodded, her auburn hair falling in front of her face. She was trying to be subtle and not hold herself directly‚Äîbut she could only be so subtle while practically straddling her carry-on luggage and pushing her backpack, sitting on top of it, into her crotch.

"Well, we're almost through security," said Sachiko. "And there's no way we're gonna board on time if we have to go through this whole queue again." She slid her hand into the crook of Em's arm to pull her in a little closer, a little farther away from her backpack, and whispered into her ear: "You can hold it for ten more minutes, right? You won't make it to the surprise at the end if you wet yourself this early."

"S-surprise? We didn't talk about‚Äî"

"Yeah, I prepared a little something extra for you."

"Oh God, Sacchi. Today's going to be so much." In her voice, on her lips, glee fought desperation for the spotlight.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the plan,‚Äù said Sachiko.

Just then, desperation won out: her smile quickly turned into panic as her hand snapped to her black skirt, pushing the fabric into her crotch.

"That's the plan. Come on, you can hold it, Em. I believe in you." Sachiko kissed her on the cheek, then took a quick nip at her earlobe as she moved away.

"Do that again when I'm not too distracted to enjoy it!"

"No refills!"

"Sachi-i-i-i!"

~***~

The security agent was, to Emily's great relief, sympathetic to her squirming: he screened her luggage quickly and pointed her to the nearest bathroom in his lilting Qu√©b√©cois accent: "Just through this corridor and to your left.‚Äù

"Okay-thanks-have-a-nice-day!" Emily darted down the hallway, backpack over one shoulder and carry-on luggage rolling behind her.

Sachiko stared at her quickly retreating butt, wishing she could follow along to the bathroom. Their little travel games hadn't started yet, but that didn't stop her thinking about the hiss of her stream, or wanting to make out with her as soon as she walked out of the stall. Or, better, making out with her mid-stream. In fact, Sachiko was starting to feel a little pressure in her bladder herself. That thought sent her on another journey of fantasies‚Äîbut one that definitely wouldn't be comfortable nor appropriate in a public bathroom.

When it came to airport security, Sachiko hadn't been quite as lucky as Emily: the agent in front of her felt like she was taking her time scrutinising her carry-on, a sour look on her face. Had she brought anything that could seem suspicious on the X-ray? She had taken out her empty metal water bottles and her laptop, and she didn't think there was anything else that would come up...

But she'd preferred not answering any questions about the pack of diapers the agent had just lifted out of the bag.

"Okay, you're all good," the agent said abruptly, and immediately grabbed the next bin in line.

"Thanks," Sachiko muttered. She stuffed everything back into her backpack and sped down the hallway.

As soon as she turned around the corner, she found Emily walking out of the bathroom.

"Ah, piss," said Sachiko. "I missed it, didn‚Äôt I?"

"Yup, that's exactly what you missed." A dimple highlighted Emily's smirk. She leaned down a little, bringing her mouth to Sachiko's ear. "I have a surprise for you, though. It might be a little darker than you like, bu-u-u-ut..."

She dangled a paper cup in front of Sachiko's face, a light amber liquid sloshing about. Grinning, Sachiko grabbed the cup and quickly downed the liquid‚Äîabout a shot's worth, in the end.

She didn't dare make a sound, with people walking in and out of the bathroom. But with her back to the gate waiting area, and only the bathroom doors in front of her, she allowed herself to slowly lick her lips, hungry gaze looking deep into Emily's eyes.

Emily doubled over giggling. "I'm glad you liked it."

"I guess that means our little game has officially started."

"You should probably pee first, too."

"Oh, you're right." Their games were only supposed to start after both of them had peed into the toilet‚Äîthe only time they were allowed to do that without each other‚Äôs permission today. Sachiko handed her luggage over to Emily. "Maybe you could fill us up on water while I'm in there?" She nodded to the water fountain right beside them, in between the two bathroom doors.

"Only if you pay me in gold!"

"Fi-i-ine." She walked past Emily, swinging the empty paper cup dramatically in front of her face, and pushed the bathroom door open.

Sachiko hadn't really noticed much of a need to pee, not except while she was waiting for that security agent to finish rooting through her things. But now that she was in a stall, toilet in front of her, the bathroom‚Äôs echoing acoustics around her, her bladder throbbed, begging to void itself right now. It didn't help that she could feel the diaper on her, either‚Äîall sensors were pointing to, it‚Äôs safe to let go.

Moving gingerly, she unbuckled her belt, and then slipped both her hands under the waistband of the shapewear she used to keep the diaper subtle, then her black trousers, then the diaper. She tried pushing them all down in one smooth motion‚Äîbut they were all far too tight, and it took her several wiggles, torturous on her bladder, before she could get everything down to mid-thigh.

She squatted over the toilet and, her knees barely bent, her butt very definitely not anywhere near the seat, gave in and let go. The hissing of pee from her lips was forceful, followed immediately the sound of a waterfall in the toilet. The release of tension on her bladder immediately sent a shiver through her abdomen, to her butthole, up her spine and through her shoulders. She dropped onto the seat of the toilet, enjoying the warmth over her lips, so starkly contrasting against the cold bathroom air against her butt and the rest of her pussy.

She knew she was already incredibly wet from Emily's desperation, from Emily's teasing. Now she was impossibly wet‚Äîand that was excluding all the pee.

As her stream began waning, she suddenly remembered the cup in her hand. She cut her stream off‚Äîa little too suddenly, a little bit painfully‚Äîand started pushing her trousers down to her ankles, so she could spread her legs out. With one hand holding her lips spread (so warm and wet!), she half-filled the cup in her other hand, then let the rest of her pee trickle into the toilet.

Her pee was a pale amber, still pretty light in colour, but a little darker than Emily's. That probably explained why Emily was so much more desperate than Sachiko‚Äîthat and her smaller bladder, of course. Sachiko knew very well how easily she could outcompete Emily in a pee hold or a pee measuring contest.

Sachiko folded up some toilet paper and wiped her labia, trying to dry off both her pee and her vaginal wetness. She quickly pulled up her trousers, got her outfit back together, and washed her hands.

So had begun their little travel games. Both their first pees having been peed, Sachiko was now totally at Emily's mercy‚Äîin bathroom, in drinking, in libido‚Äîand Emily, at Sachiko's. That would be their next twenty hours, until they checked into their hotel in T≈çky≈ç.

Emily's cupful of payment in hand, Sachiko pulled the bathroom door open.

A little transition and character-building chapter. No peeing or desperation in this one, but I hope all the flirting and teasing that's going on makes up for it!

My apologies to any other engineers or office workers for whom the phone call may trigger unpleasant memories.

Chapter 2

Sachiko found Emily sitting on a seat near the bathrooms, swinging a water bottle on her finger, phone to her ear. ‚ÄúListen, Rav,‚Äù she was saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry you‚Äôre having to deal with this. It‚Äôs my job to shield you from this kind of arrogant asshole usually.‚Äù

Sachiko sat down beside Emily, presenting her the cup, as she kept talking.

‚ÄúBut you are acting team lead now, and‚Äîhi, Sachiko. Thanks.‚Äù She grabbed the cup and took a sip, before sputtering and coughing. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm okay. Sorry, Sachiko brought me a cup of‚Äîer‚Äîan espresso and it was a lot stronger than I expected.‚Äù Her face had gone beet red.

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù whispered Sachiko, wrapping an arm around her and giving her a squeeze. Emily gave her a stiff nod back.

‚ÄúYeah, er, so, what was I saying?‚Ä¶ right. Like, you know how you said you‚Äôd like to be a team lead? Dealing with arrogant demanding team leads like this, or even managers, is something you‚Äôll have to learn. It‚Äôs part of shielding your team from distractions. Yeah. Feel free to defer decisions back to me, I know how to deal with his attitude. Yeah. Yeah. Sure, Slack me how it went. Yeah. Good luck, I believe in you. Bye.‚Äù She put down her phone and sighed.

‚ÄúTrouble at work?‚Äù asked Sachiko.

‚ÄúKind of. Steven‚Äôs trying to give my team orders and treating them like technicians again. He just‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt understand that engineering is more than just cobbling together some parts off the shelf.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶and he‚Äôs doing this at eight in the morning?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe sent a bad email last night and is demanding a meeting this morning. I think I might have to escalate this to Lana when we get back home, honestly.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds like a lot of fun.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me. Don‚Äôt worry, Rav can handle it for a week.‚Äù Emily suddenly remembered the cup in her hand, and raised it up to Sachiko‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúHey, so, about this‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, sorry,‚Äù Sachiko said quickly. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt occur to me you‚Äôd be distracted.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs fine. Thanks for this.‚Äù She blushed again. ‚ÄúIt was a pleasant surprise, just‚Ä¶ a little weird getting that kind of gift when my brain is at work. I honestly thought you brought me coffee, and then suddenly I‚Äôve got work in my ear and pleasure in my mouth.‚Äù

Sachiko burst out laughing. ‚ÄúWell‚Äîwell, if it‚Äôs any consolation, you know I get super turned on at seeing you in work mode.‚Äù Staring into Emily‚Äôs eyes, bringing her hand up to her face, Sachiko brushed a lock of hair out of her face and gazed into her bright, pretty eyes. She was trying to shift the tone towards the sensual, but she was sure her laughter was still showing up on her lips. Especially with what she was about to add: ‚ÄúGirlboss.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh my God, Sacchi, no! Don‚Äôt call me that.‚Äù

‚ÄúFi-i-ine.‚Äù She nodded at the cup. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you finish that so I can make out with you?‚Äù

Emily looked down at the cup. ‚ÄúThis sure is dark, Sacchi. You should‚Äôve drunk more this morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou grabbed the bottle before I could!‚Äù

‚ÄúEh, still. I‚Äôm sure it was a wonderful pee.‚Äù She grinned at Sachiko. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure you had to go pretty badly too, didn‚Äôt you? I‚Äôm just imagining the hiss, and all that nectar gushing from between your lips, your tight pants barely down your butt.

‚ÄúEm, I‚Äôd like to be able to make out with you before our flight starts boarding.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, and you must have been so wet! Seeing me so fidgeting and holding myself, imagining what happened after I ran ahead of you, getting your own little cup‚Ä¶ God, I wish I could‚Äôve licked you clean‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHow hecking wet are you making yourself right now?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs too late for me. My diaper got drenched a long time ago, missy. I mean, you and that cute security guard seeing me squirm and dance?‚Äù Emily grinned mischievously. ‚ÄúWell, anyway. Down the hatch!‚Äù She downed the cup of golden liquid in two big gulps. ‚ÄúMm, salty. I‚Äôll consider that full payment for filling up the water bottles, then.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I still haven‚Äôt paid you back for making me wet. So, how about we settle that account now?‚Äù Sachiko abruptly moved her hand behind Emily‚Äôs head and pulled her towards her, pulled her lips to her own. Emily tensed up, not expecting Sachiko‚Äôs impatience‚Äîthen her body relaxed into the kiss, moaning as Sachiko gently caressed Emily‚Äôs lower lip between her own. She tasted her own saltiness on those lips, and felt Emily‚Äôs hastening breath on her cheeks. She opened her mouth and licked Emily‚Äôs lips‚Äî

A sound intruded in the back of her mind: it was the characteristic takita-ta, taka-ta rhythm from Holst‚Äôs ‚ÄúMars, Bringer of War‚Äù. The music she‚Äôd set as her phone alarm. She held the kiss, giving her phone a moment to ramp up the volume before deciding she was, in fact, not hallucinating that alarm.

‚ÄúDamn it,‚Äù she said, pulling back. Emily pouted. ‚ÄúI told you we wouldn‚Äôt have time to make out if you kept teasing me.‚Äù She pulled her phone out of her purse‚Äôs front pocket and dismissed the alarm. ‚ÄúTen minutes to boarding‚Äîwe should go find our gate.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna have to wait at the gate anyway,‚Äù Emily said, in a lilting teasing tone. ‚ÄúI expect the rest of that make-out session then!‚Äù
