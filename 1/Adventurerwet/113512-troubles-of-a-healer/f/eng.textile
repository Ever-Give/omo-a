(This is just a quick little thing inspired by events I've seen in a certain MMO being friends with healer mains/seeing some things personally myself)

Being a healer was often rewarding being on the receiving end of praise, many a thanks and plenty of invitations to tag along for many adventures and Of course lots of treasure. But there was often a wearier side of being a healer. "Healer! hurry up!"

"No, we can't stop for a mana break you just had one"

"That was totally your fault healer!" Elandra had heard this and many more but at the end of the day she was still a dedicated priestess and healer even when the party she found herself in had her downing drink after drink to keep her stores of mana full and replenished one such day she found herself squirming as she stood having to use her staff to balance properly when she wasn't following the groups lead she found herself pressing her legs together eventually she had to speak up "Guys can I get a few moments here?" only to be on the end of a mix of groans, sighs even a few "Seriously again? we're going too slow.

No, we're not going to stop you need to learn to keep up" Elandra let out a quiet little whimper as she started to find it harder to focus on her role as a healer her thoughts on the growing need her body reaching its limits as she made one last attempt to get her party to stop "G..guys...seriously..." Only for the party to ignore her pleas rushing along.

As her pleas fell on deaf ears Elandra started to slow down coming to a halt her legs pressed together intently as it happened Elandra whimpered as the front of her robe started to grow damp, the priestess unable to stop as her body took over she simply held onto her staff tightly as the sound of liquid hitting the ground was heard the many drinks emptying out of her steadily for a few moments finding herself in soaked robes standing in her own puddle eventually finding herself pouting for a moment as she looked down her pristine white robes now darkened with the dampness leaving a sight none would question as anything but an accident.

Only for her to hear in the distance "Where's the healer!? this is the last time we bring her along she's so slow!" Elandra grumbled slowly walking ahead to catch up with her group muttering out quietly "I'm taking all the gold we find for a new robe..." (Hopefully this is enjoyable to read I'm not the best writer but still after seeing many healers being dragged along by impatient tanks begging for mana breaks this idea was made)

Oh yes having a friend who enjoys playing healer many times after a dungeon she's been frustrated with tanks ignoring her low mana or rushing her along
