Sombra's fingers danced across her keyboard, upgrading her cyber tech with a wicked grin on her face. She had done it - her hacking was now universal, capable of infiltrating anything running on technology.

With a mischievous glint in her eye, Sombra decided it was time to have some fun. She set her sights on Overwatch, the team she loved to mess with the most.

In the dead of night, Sombra stealthily infiltrated the Overwatch base, her cybernetic enhancements helping her move undetected. She reached the main fuse box, her fingers flying over the keys as she tapped into the system.

As she hacked into the fuse box, a devious smile played on Sombra's lips. She disabled all the bathroom doors in the base and initiated a complete lockdown - no one would be able to leave or enter for the next 32 hours.

Sombra's laughter echoed through the base as she celebrated her successful test of the new upgrade, saying "It works better than I expected!" With a satisfied smirk, she made her way out of the base, already relishing the chaos she will cause.

In the morning at the Overwatch base, Angela Ziegler was in her lab, carefully experimenting on her healing staff, making slight adjustments to its capabilities. The soft hum of her equipment filled the room as she focused on her work.

Brigitte entered the room tired, her toned body showing from her tank top pajama shirt. Angela couldn't help but tease, "You seem well-rested. Did you have a good sleep in your armored pajamas, Brigitte?"

With a hint of sarcasm, Brigitte shot back, "Oh, it was just a dreamy night, Angela. You should try it sometime."

Angela grinned, enjoying their playful banter. "Is Hana up yet?" she inquired, curious about their fellow teammate.

Shrugging, Brigitte replied, "I'm not sure. She might be in the hangar with her meka."

As Angela continued her modifications, Brigitte asked, "Do you need any help with that staff of yours? I could lend a hand, save us some time."

Accepting Brigitte's offer, Angela nodded, "That would be great, Brigitte. Thank you."

Brigitte smiled, "I'll be right back. Just need to hit the little girls' room first."

But as Brigitte pushed on the door to the lab's bathroom, it wouldn't budge. Confusion crossed her face, and she awkwardly crossed her legs, feeling the urge to pee growing stronger.

Noticing Brigitte's struggle, Angela inquired, "What's wrong, Brigitte?"

Frustration evident in her voice, Brigitte replied, "The door won't open, Angela. It's locked tight."

Angela furrowed her brow, puzzled by the locked bathroom door. She got up from her desk and approached the door, attempting to open it with no success.

Turning to Brigitte, she suggested, "There are other bathrooms in the base you could try, if you can make it."

Brigitte awkwardly made her way to the other bathrooms, and five minutes ticked by before she returned with a worried expression. "All the bathrooms are locked and disabled," she informed Angela.

Angela's eyes widened in shock and confusion. "That's not possible," she muttered.

Brigitte, bouncing up and down while crossing her legs, said, "I don't want to pee anywhere else. I'll just hold it in."

Angela, concerned, replied, "I understand, but that's not healthy. I'll check the main servers to see what's going on."

Angela furrowed her brows, her fingers flying across her keyboard as she accessed the main servers. The screen flickered to life, displaying rows of data indicating that everything was functioning normally within the Overwatch base.

Confusion clouded Angela's features as she muttered to herself, "There shouldn't be any issues according to this."

Brigitte shifted from foot to foot, crossing her legs and bouncing slightly as she struggled to contain her growing discomfort. "Angela, this is getting really bad."

Angela turned to Brigitte, her expression mirroring the concern in the younger woman's voice. "It seems like there might be a fault in the system. You'll have to hold it for now, Brigitte. It's not safe, but hopefully, the doors will start working soon."

Brigitte took a deep breath, trying to steady herself. "I'll be fine. I'm used to holding it for a bit. Just hoped this gets fixed quickly."

Hana Song sauntered into the lab, her pajama crop top and panties exposed for everyone to see. "Hey, guys, did you notice the bathroom doors are all locked?" she asked, a hint of annoyance in her voice.

Angela looked up from her desk. "It seems like there might be a faulty problem with the doors," she said, concern lacing her tone. "Do you need to use the bathroom, Hana?"

Hana groaned at the mention of the faulty doors but replied, "Actually, I was planning to take a shower. Guess that'll have to wait."

Brigitte chimed in, holding her shorts "Well, lucky you. My bladder's about to burstâ€¦"

Angela stood up from her desk, beckoning Hana to join them. "Come over here, let's discuss this," she said, her voice firm but comforting.

As Hana walked over, Angela continued, "We don't know when the doors will fix themselves. The best we can do for now is to try and limit how much fluid we consume and monitor our bladders to avoid needing to pee."

Hana and Brigitte exchanged determined looks, nodding in agreement. They understood the situation and were willing to try and follow Angela’s orders. However, not a single one knew of how bad this day was going to getâ€¦

A few hours passed since the lockdown began at the Overwatch base. In her room, Hana, in her pajamas, sat cross-legged on her bed, her legs bouncing up and down as she played video games.

Desperate to pee, Hana tried every trick she could think of to hold it in. She crossed her legs tightly, squeezed her thighs together, and even held her crotch, trying not to think about the growing pressure in her bladder.

As the game intensified, Hana's focus wavered. She started to lose control, the urge to pee becoming almost unbearable. With a deep breath, she finally quit the game and stood up, trying to hold it in while remaining calm.

"I would do anything to pee in a toilet right now," Hana murmured to herself, feeling the discomfort gnawing at her.

Despite the mounting problem, Hana refused to give in. She was determined to hold it in until the bathroom doors fixed themselves, no matter how challenging it became. The struggle continued, with each passing minute feeling like an eternity.

Brigitte was going through a difficult time as she tried to hold it in. With each passing minute, the pressure in her bladder increased. She felt like she might genuinely burst, but she was determined to control herself.

As she shifted uncomfortably in her seat, Brigitte couldn't ignore the urgent call of nature. Feeling her stomach, she noticed a small, round bulge below her belly button. Her bladder was starting to expand, signaling the urgency of her situation.

"I need to pee so badly," Brigitte muttered to herself, trying to stay focused on the task at hand. Angela, who was in the lab with Brigitte, noticed her discomfort. Crossing her own legs and bouncing slightly to hold in her own pee, she asked, "Are you okay, Brigitte?"

"I'm fine," Brigitte replied through gritted teeth, willing herself to continue adjusting Angela's healing staff. The pressure was becoming unbearable, but she couldn't afford to lose focus now.

Brigitte winced, feeling the pressure in her bladder growing unbearable. Her body tensed as she struggled to focus on the task at hand, the urgency to relieve herself becoming more intense by the minute. She glanced over at Angela, who appeared calm on the outside but Brigitte could see the slight twitch in her leg that betrayed her inner turmoil.

"Angela, do you need to sit down for a bit?" Brigitte asked, her voice quivering with discomfort.

Angela managed a strained smile, her hand subtly pressing against her bulging abdomen as she moved up and down, trying to alleviate some of the pressure. "No, thank you, Brigitte. I just... drank a bit too much coffee this morning. I'll manage," she replied, her voice laced with a hint of desperation.

Angela’s mind was racing, trying to maintain her composure as she fought the desperate urge to let go. Her jeans' button and zipper were undone, her belt hanging loosely as she shifted her weight from one foot to the other. The need to find relief was becoming increasingly urgent.

Despite her own discomfort, Angela couldn't help but notice the pained expression on Brigitte's face. With a shaky breath, she forced herself to focus on the task at hand, silently hoping for a resolution to their predicament.

Several hours had passed since the beginning of the lockdown at the Overwatch base. The bathroom doors remained stubbornly shut, much to the increasing discomfort of Angela and Brigitte. The tension in the room was palpable as they all struggled with their urgent need to relieve themselves.

Suddenly, the lab door creaked open, and Hana slowly trudged in. She placed one hand on the wall for support, the other desperately clutching her big bulging abdomen as she tried to contain the massive amount of pee inside her.

Angela and Brigitte looked up at her, their expressions a mix of worry and empathy as they witnessed Hana's obvious distress.

"Has anyone exploded in their pants yet?" Hana stuttered in agony, the urgency evident in her voice.

Brigitte, barely able to muster any words through her discomfort, managed to shake her head weakly. "N-not yet, but I might soon."

Angela, rubbing her own bulging bladder and crossing her legs tightly, tried to maintain a reassuring tone. "We'll make it, Hana. Just keep holding on."

Brigitte couldn't take it anymore. The pressure was unbearable. "How much are we holding?" she managed to gasp out, her voice strained.

Angela, feeling a sense of urgency, turned to a nearby computer that housed the current anatomy status and x-rays of all three of them when they joined Overwatch. As she scanned the screen, warning labels popped up over each x-ray, indicating dangerous levels of bladder distention.

With a shaky voice, Angela began to read the status out loud. "Brigitte, you have 3.4 liters in your bladder," she said, her own discomfort evident. Brigitte let out a loud groan of desperation and agony, her hands clutching her swollen abdomen.

Turning to Hana, Angela continued, "Hana, you have 3.6 liters in your bladder." Hana whimpered in response, the urge to go becoming almost unbearable.

Finally, Angela's own turn came. "And I have 3.4 liters in my bladder," she moaned in pain, feeling the pressure mounting by the second.

Hana managed to speak through the discomfort, "Too much nano cola."

Brigitte added in a strained voice, "Too much water."

Angela confessed, "Too much coffee."

The trio all grabbed their bulging abdomens, holding on as the urgency to relieve themselves grew stronger by the minute.

Angela's eyes widened as she noticed the label on the computer screen for Hana's x-ray, indicating a leakage. She turned to look at Hana, only to see Hana looking down, a little bit of pee trickling down her crossed legs from her panties.

"Hana, you're leaking," Angela exclaimed, concern evident in her voice.

Hana looked up with a desperate expression. "I'm gonna burst soon," she said, her voice strained.

Angela tried to reassure her, "Just hold out a bit longer, we'll find a way to fix this."

But Brigitte interjected, her voice tight with strain, "We're all about to hit our limits. It's only a matter of time until we all burst."

Angela felt a surge of panic rising within her. She leaned on the table, double-crossing her legs tightly. "I refuse to piss myself," she declared, her voice determined.

Meanwhile, Hana continued to leak a bit, her face contorted in a mixture of discomfort and determination. She double-crossed her own legs and jammed her hands between her legs against her crotch, trying to hold in her pee.

"Come on, come on," Hana whispered to herself, her resolve wavering as she struggled to keep it all in despite the leaking.

Angela stood there, her legs double-crossed, the urgency in her eyes matching the determination in her voice. With a resolute nod, she took the cup of coffee in her hand and drank it all in large gulps, surprising Brigitte and Hana.

Brigitte's eyes widened, "Are you crazy, Angela? You're going to burst!"

But Angela wasn't kidding about refusing to pee herself. She seemed determined to keep it all in, no matter how full she was. Sitting down at her computer, she tried to focus on her work while also holding herself tightly to prevent any accidents.

"I'm going to try and force open the doors through the mainframe," Angela announced to Brigitte and Hana, her fingers flying across the keyboard despite her lack of expertise in hacking. She was desperate, and time was running out.

As Angela delved into the base servers, trying to override the lockdown protocols, a small leak began to seep through her pants, a visible sign that she was nearing her limit. But she gritted her teeth and continued her efforts, the urgency growing with each passing second.

Brigitte groaned in pain, her hand firmly pressed against her lower abdomen, while Hana whimpered and moaned softly, her struggle becoming more evident as she slowly leaked. The tension in the room was unbearable, the pressure building with each passing moment.

All three women were on the brink of bursting, the consequences of their nano cola, water, and coffee consumption catching up to them. The clock was ticking, and the situation was becoming increasingly dire.

Angela's fingers danced across the keyboard, her eyes focused on the screen as she frantically searched for a way to override the lockdown. With a surge of determination, she began tweaking the system, hoping her skills would be enough to lift the restrictions that had kept them trapped.

A short amount of time passed, tension thick in the air, before, as if by magic, the lockdown lifted. The bathroom doors slid open with a soft hiss, revealing the much-needed relief just on the other side.

Brigitte stood up, her hand tightly gripping her crotch as she rubbed the massive bulge of her full bladder with her other hand. Hana looked at Brigitte nervously, seeing the desperation in her eyes. Brigitte met her gaze, nodding her head towards the now-open bathroom, silently urging Hana to go first.

Without hesitation, Hana sprinted for the bathroom, her movements a mix of desperation and relief. She swung the door shut behind her, finally able to let go and release the pressure that had been building up for far too long.

Angela and Brigitte waited anxiously, the sound of running water echoing in the room. Brigitte turned to Angela, concern etched on her face. "Do you want to go next?" she asked, her own need pressing urgently.

Angela shook her head, her hand still cradling her soccer ball-sized bulge. "I can manage," she insisted, her voice strained but determined.

As the tension of their prolonged wait began to ease, Hana emerged from the bathroom, looking and feeling visibly relieved. She sank into a chair, a look of contentment on her face as she finally allowed herself to relax.

Brigitte wasted no time, racing to the bathroom and closing the door behind her, eager to find the same sense of relief that Hana had just experienced. Angela sat back, her own need still overwhelming, but her focus unwavering as she prepared to face her turn.

Brigitte finally emerged from the bathroom, her expression a mix of relief and exhaustion. She wearily sank into a nearby chair, letting out a contented sigh.

Angela, feeling the pressure of her full bladder increasing with each step, got up slowly from her seat. "Don't burst, don't burst," she muttered to herself, tightly gripping her crotch as she made her way to the bathroom. Her bulging bladder was noticeable under her shirt, a clear sign of her dire need.

Once inside the bathroom, Angela closed the door behind her, finally allowing herself to release the gallon of pee she had been holding in. The sound of rushing liquid was a welcome relief as she emptied her bladder.

A few minutes later, Angela emerged from the bathroom and returned to her chair, visibly more relaxed and calm after the ordeal of holding in so much urine.

"I felt like I was going to explode," Hana confessed, her face still flushed from the experience.

Brigitte nodded in agreement, "I felt the same way. That was intense."

Angela chimed in with a hint of humor, "I could have held it a bit longer if I wanted to."

Hana playfully rolled her eyes, "Show off."

Angela was focused on her computer when she heard a muffled voice coming from the security camera near her desk. Frowning, she glanced at the screen and saw Sombra, the notorious hacker, looking incredibly uncomfortable.

Hana and Brigitte rushed over to see what was happening. Sombra's face contorted in pain as she held her stomach, her bladder visibly bulging out like a watermelon.

"I... I messed up," Sombra stuttered, beads of sweat forming on her forehead. "I need a toilet... fast."

Hana and Brigitte burst into laughter, realizing that she had been behind their turmoil, and that the tables had turned. Angela couldn't help but smile mischievously as she returned to her computer, quickly initiating the lockdown once again.

"Payback time," Hana chuckled, her eyes sparkling with mischief.

Sombra's eyes widened in panic as she realized that the base went back into lockdown. She pounded on the wall, desperation clear in her voice as she plead for the lockdown to end again.

Angela leaned back in her chair, a satisfied grin on her face. "Let's see how she likes being stuck," she said, reveling in the opportunity to mess with Sombra.

Sombra stood there, her bladder painfully full, feeling like it might burst at any moment. She held her bulging bladder with one hand, the other jammed tightly between her crossed legs, trying to maintain control. Her bladder bulge was massive, weighing her down, forcing her to slouch against the wall for support.

Looking up at the camera, Sombra stuttered in pain, pleading for relief. "I-I don't wanna pee myself," she whimpered, desperation evident in her voice. "I'm gonna explode soon!"

But in Angela's office, Brigitte, Hana, and Angela were oblivious to Sombra's plight, lounging comfortably and chatting. Sombra's pleas for mercy fell on deaf ears as she battled against the mounting pressure in her bladder.

As Sombra gritted her teeth, she felt a trickle of pee escape, running down her leggings, a clear sign that she was reaching her breaking point. "Open, open," she muttered to herself, her voice strained with agony. "I don't want to burst. Not like this."

Sombra leaned against the locked bathroom door, her body trembling as she slouched over, desperate for relief. She banged on the door, hoping it would miraculously open, but it remained stubbornly shut. With each movement, she leaked a little more pee, her bladder on the brink of exploding.

"Please, please, open up!" Sombra pleaded, her voice strained with desperation. "I'm going to burst, please!"

Frantically, she jammed both of her hands into her crotch, trying to hold back the onslaught of pressure. But as she fought against it, the leaks became more frequent, her control slipping away.

"Come on, come on, come on!" Sombra repeated the words like a desperate mantra, her voice tinged with panic.

Then, in a sudden gasp, Sombra lost the battle. She moaned loudly in a mix of relief and humiliation as she felt herself finally and uncontrollably pee herself. Her bladder, once painfully full, began to shrink as she stood there, the warmth of her pee spreading down her legs.

Hana's eyes widened as she stared at the screen, watching Sombra desperately trying to hold back her pee. "Holy shit," she exclaimed, pointing at the live feed. "Sombra is peeing herself!"

Angela and Brigitte turned their attention to the screen, their expressions shifting from discomfort to amusement. The three girls burst into laughter as they witnessed Sombra's humiliation in real-time.

Minutes passed by, Sombra's body finally giving in as she stopped peeing, exhausted from the intense holding.

Sombra's eyes flicked to the camera that had captured her embarrassing moment. Her face flushed with a mix of embarrassment and anger as she defiantly stuck up her middle finger. "Whoever did this is going to pay for making me lose control, I swear!"

Angela, still laughing uncontrollably, managed to compose herself long enough to disable the lockdown, allowing Sombra to turn invisible as she made a hasty exit from the base, seething with humiliation and rage.
