A very specific request here…

A while ago I read a story about a girl who got home after a long day at work desperate to poop only to sit down onto the toilet about to relieve only to look up and see she has no toilet paper, this results in her having to retract her prairie dog and drive all the way to the closest store to get more toilet paper while absolutely dying for a poop.

If anyone has this story or knows where I could find it please let me know.
