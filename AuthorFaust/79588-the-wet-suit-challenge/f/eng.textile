[The Wet Suit Challenge, Part 2]

"Ame, what are we going to do?" the blonde pleaded with her friend. "If we can't go in there without someone seeing, but we can't finish the video without a pool...."

"Minnie, I think you've got more important things to worry about than a damn pool!" Amelia snapped back at her friend. "You're going to be caught with... Well, with a very telling mark on that suit if you stand around, OR if you go in there."

"Awawaaaaa.... What do we do...?" Minnie whimpered, flushing a bright pink as her friend's hand held her head.

'Stupid Minnie, never thinking these things through...' Amelia internally groused. 'I should just let her stew in this.... But, the thought of some creep ogling her... Eugh...'

There was a deafening silence over the two girls, as Minnie's gaze kept shuffling left and right, looking out for anyone who would arrive. Her feet still graced the puddle of her own creation gingerly, prompting a steady flush to her face, before Amelia turned to her foolhardy friend.

"Alright, I have an idea." She called. "There's a public pool out in town a few blocks away..."

"Ah? But what if my suit dries out before we get there?" Minnie inquired. 'There's gotta be something closer, so.."

"Minnie, are you really that focused on your stupid Tren-Door challenge?" Amelia snapped, earning another long silence. "...Oh my God, you're hopeless..."

"W..Well, I mean.." the blonde nervously stammered, poking her fingers together. "I...I already peed my suit... It feels like such a waste to quit now.."

"I....ugh...Whatever.." Amelia groaned, not entirely for the matter of her friend's focus on a stupid internet trend. Truthfully, Amelia felt more than a soft pang of trouble brewing down below, but if there was one thing more important to her than bodily urges, it was helping her oh-so-stupid friend out. Though, as she started to wrack her brain...

"It doesn't... have to be a pool, right?"

"Ah?" Minnie sounded, as she tilted her head. "I...erm...I don't... think so...Lemme check."

The blonde reach for her phone, having tucked it away in her bikini top, prompting a flat look from Amelia.

"You were going to short out your phone if we'd gone in, were you?" she quipped, as Minnie bopped her friend's side.

"Ah, shaddup." she quipped back. "I wasn't gonna leave my phone in your room. I didn't forget to drop it off..."

Amelia doubted the integrity of that statement, as Minnie's phone called out.

'Get your swimsuit wet....'

Ssssshhh...Ssssssshhhh.

'And the hard part...is to get to a body of water, without anyone knowing you peed! A pool, a lake, You cou-'

"Okay, now that we confirmed that..' Amelia cut off the video, feeling her legs tense up some more as the nagging sensation pounded away at her. "There's a fountain at the front entrance of the college. You could jump into that, couldn't you?"

"Ame, you're a Genius!" Minnie mused, leaping over to hug her friend, who backed away from her hurriedly.

"Ah, no hugs while you're in peed clothes, thank you!" she rebuffed. "Let's just get over there, and get this over with already!"

Minnie pouted, but gave a small nod of understanding as she started to walk with her friend... Whose pace had been staggered more than a little, prompting her to actually move ahead.

"You know Ame, you...are wearing a swimsuit too." Minnie started, earning her a small, but vicious glare from her friend.

"Astute observation..." She bit back a bit more venomously than usual, as the blonde flanked her other side.

"And i mean.. We're about to get to a fountain...." She added, the glare darkening some more.

"Do not.."

"I mean, it wouldn't be a big deal if..."

"Minnie, i swear...."

"You just.... you know....."

"Minnie..."

"Participated in the challenge with me."

"MINNIE." Amelia snapped, stopping in place. "I told you a hundred thousand times. I'm not into these Trendor......Bullshit..Challenges.."

"But Ameeeee!" Minnie remarked. "I don't even mean the challenges! You're all shaking, and tensing. I'm just saying, you look like you really need to go anyways, and..."

"I'm....Fine..." Amelia snapped, one of her legs crossing over the other. "I'm not like you, I can.... Hold it, until this is over... And go to the bathroom."

"But it would be so much easier to...." Minnie started, as Amelia turned away.

"If you ask me one more time, you're not getting your video." she demanded, moving as if she was about to ditch her friend. Minnie quickly shifted gears, moving in front of her friend once more.

"Okayokayokay, I won't ask!" she remarked. "Just... please don't leave! We've come so far...!"

That was an understatement. She'd been at this stupid challenge thing for... what felt like a few hours, as she kept along the path with her friend, moving closer to their destination.... Stopping every few feet to keep herself in control, as she tried to busy her mind with other things.

The upcoming midterms in Calculus, the Bio lab project they'd no doubt be getting in a few days....How unbearably hot it was getting lately....

All various distractions, before Minnie called out.

"Ah..! There it is!" She piped up, snapping her concentration. "The fountain! Ame, get your Camera ready!"

Amelia breathed a tensed sigh of relief, as the end goal was in sight.

The fountain was some decoration from long before the two were even born, much less since they started attending college. It looked to be about fifteen feet high, with water that very easily, came up to one's knees (Or thighs on some of the smaller students) The water gushed upwards a few feet extra, at a steady and regular rhythm, splashing about merrily..

Pang....pang..

A noise and thought process that made Amelia bend at the knees, as she reach down for her camera.

"So.. Just gotta grab a quick video of you..." she started, pausing as her knees knocked. "Hopping in... yeah?"

"Yeah! That'll do it!" Minnie called. "Oh, though you might need to stand back to get a good shot!"

Amelia gave a tensed nod, and pulled out her camera, looking up to record her friend, still seeing the dampness on the back of her swimsuit... And more than a few drips still trailing down her thighs.

Ksssshshssshsssshsshsshsh

The sounds of the fountain were almost unbearable for Amelia, as she struggled to keep the camera steady, and Minnie turned around.

"Is it rolling?" she asked, as Amelia finally let her free hand snake down to apply some much needed pressure.

"Yeah... Yeah, Go!" she called out, as the blonde stared at the fountain for a few scant moments...

And then a few more.... And more... and more...

Amelia's legs quivered, as she started to sneer.

"Minnie! It's ready..!" She called out impatiently, as the girl lightly rubbed her head.

"Um... do you think I'll get in trouble if I.." she started, as Amelia's hand clasped over her own face.

"MINNIE, GET IN THE DAMN WATER!' She snapped, before feeling it..

Sssssh...

A small sputter of warmth, marring her dry, dark suit. It wasn't a sizable leak, by any stretch... But, it was a leak nevertheless... Which meant warning bells were now going off in her head, as she struggled to keep the camera steady.

'As soon as we get this footage, I am.......' she thought, as her hand shot back to her crotch, applying much needed pressure. 'DONE helping with these stupid..challenges..'

What was more upsetting however, was rather than getting it over with a hop, skip, and a jump, Minnie was taking her time stepping over, her foot touching the water for an instant, before quickly jerking back out.

"Ahhhh..!!! It's cold..!!!!" she snapped out, as Amelia swore sharply under her breath.

"Minnie, Get in the fucking water before I piss my pants." She snapped out way too loudly, as the blonde turned, and chuckled nervously.

"Ahaha... Ri..right, Right. Lemme just.." She called, reaching her foot over again.... Flinching as it touched the water, before slowly sinking in.

"Hurry up..!" Amelia snarled, as the blonde's body shivered wildly.

"It's like...really cold..!" she protested. "I just....Ah...Wait, right!"

Amelia groaned even louder as she squeezed herself, the blonde pulling her phone out of her bikini top again, and setting it on the side of the fountain. The raven haired girl could feel her body starting to protest all of these delays, coupled with the auditory torture that was the fountain, before finally Minnie got her other foot into the water (with another soft Yelp), and then sank down into a squat.

"Aaahaahaaahh.... It's so cold..." She griped.... "Bu...b...But...Th..that should be it, R..r..right..?"

Amelia swore in relief as she started to set the camera down, finally glad to be done with this stupid challenge....Before..

"Oh wow, good idea!"

"How come we didn't think about that?"

"The pool's so crowded..."

Voices. LOTS of voices suddenly rang out, as the raven haired girl looked to the side, seeing a few students all gazing in Minnie's direction. Several students, swimsuit clad and not, had taken notice of Minnie's temporary residence, and as if the fates themselves were conspiring against Amelia, all started to rush the fountain... All clamoring about the heat.

"Oh wow, it really IS cold!"

"You're a genius, Minerva!"

"Oh hey, is that Amelia over there recording?"

"This'll make a great yearbook shot!"

"Make sure to get my good side..!"

The raven haired girl seriously considered renouncing all religions, and thoughts of destiny, as she sat the camera down (To avoid the now rampant splashing of the crowds) and moved over to gather her foolhardy accomplice.".

"Minnie, we need to get out of here now." she whispered under her breath to the blonde, who was flushed a bright red amidst the untimely crowd.

"Ahaha..y..Y..Yeah..." she remarked.

"Oh, don't be like that Ame!"

"Come on, join in!"

A few errant splashes were flung her way, and as the absolutely freezing water made contact with her skin...

Sssssh...Sssssssssssshhhh..

It began. What was a small leak started to quickly progress to a steady sputtering spray of pent-up, vividly warm dampness, trickling through her suit, and down her thighs. The black haired girl flushed brightly, gripping her sides from the sheer chill of water, as her knees knocked and buckled from the sudden, serious spray of shame through her.

"Fountain party?! That's awesome! Count me in!"

"Hey, I thought we were gonna study after this!"

"I didn't bring my suit..!"

More voices...More people. Though she stood on the opposite side of the college entrance, more people could be heard joining in, splashing, and squabbling. Though she was standing in a steady growing puddle of warm shame, and freezing waters, Amelia couldn't bear to move a muscle...

'This was stupid....I shouldn't have done this'

Lingering thoughts, as the path to a proverbial salvation was blocked off by a veritable herd of people, crowding the entrance (And Fountain, too).

One steady enough look, one sharp turn in the right direction, one twist, one slight fumble downward, and someone would notice her folly...

The waters of her own personal fountain, rather than the artificial one.

'I shouldn't have let myself get egged on like this..'

If she hadn't gone along with her foolish friend's request for a stupid challenge, she wouldn't be in danger of complete social devastation...

If someone glanced over, or walked by and looked a little more closely, they'd notice that she wasn't...

Bwwwwooooooshhhh..

A massive splash suddenly soaked the girl from head to toe, as Minnie threw her whole figure into upending a massive bout of water, causing nothing short of a full body shudder of shock..

"G..G..G..Gah..!!! FUCK, that's cold..!" Amelia snapped out loudly,

Sssssshhhhh...ssssshhhh...sssshh..

As her body's steady trickles were the only thing keeping any semblance of warmth in her. Her face burned with shame still, as Minnie then climbed over the fountain once again, and took her friend's shoulder.

"Sorry, Sorry..." she called, giving a telling wink to her friend "Couldn't resist...splashing you, you know!"

Amelia cut Minnie a glare, but a small smile kept to her lips.... Thankful for the out, but also still very eager to get out of there.

"We've got a um..Project.." she called to the crowd of unaware students, moving over. "So, I'm just gonna grab my camera, and get going."

"Awwww, alright."

"Thanks for the Idea!"

"Eh Tu, Minnie?"

"Yeah, s..sorry! We've got a lot of work to do!" the blonde remarked with a forced smile. "Maybe next time!"

Amelia scooped her camera off of the ground, and started to head off with Minnie, heading back to her door room with only a few passing gazes from their soaking wet, swimsuit clad figures.

"This was still a stupid fucking idea.." Amelia chided her friend, as Minnie chuckled nervously.

"Yeah.. S..sorry about all of that." she apologized again. "I'll make it up to you, I promise!"

"You'd better.." Amelia grumbled, as the two were almost dry enough by the time they reach their dorms, Amelia leading Minnie back up to her room.

"So, think you can send me the footage tonight?" Minnie asked, as Amelia plugged her camera up to her laptop.

"Yeah, I'll send it to your phone right now.." she started, clicking away. "Then, you can do whatever you need to for your stupid little Tren-Door, and..."

"Thank you.." Minnie called, before patting at herself. "....Um...Erm.. one problem with that."

Amelia rolled her eyes, and looked at her friend.

"What's the problem now?" she added, as the girl pressed her fingers together.

"I..erm... I might have left my phone... outside.." She called, nervously. "Can you send it to my email instead? Tren-Door has a site i can do vids to, too!"

"Ugh, you're actually killing me, Minnie." Amelia snapped. "I already sent it to your phone and..."

"Butbut, If I don't find it, I can't upload it in time, and I..."

"FINE....But this is the last thing." She snapped. "You're buying me so many lunches for this whole stupid favor."

"Ehehehe.... Thanks.." Minnie added. "And... Erm...If you could edit the video too.."

"I hate you sometimes, you know that?" Amelia responded, as Minnie pounced closer, squeezing her tightly in a hug and kissing her cheek.

"Love you too, Ame!" she called. "I'm going to head back now! You're the best there ever was!"

Amelia sighed deeply as the blonde started off, and she started to run through the footage. She didn't know why, or how she kept getting talked into doing more work, but she always had a soft spot for her.

"Well, time to get to work..." She grumbled, as she started to go through the footage.

Simple enough work. Some preliminary bits with Minnie walking, desperate.... The incident of her piddling herself, and then of course, the stepping into the fountain (Cutting out the bits where Minnie kept hesitating), and it would be a video.

She left in the parts of others joining in as well, intending to wrap the video there....

Before seeing that her camera had kept running after she sat it down, showing off her own... approach of the blonde, the excess of liquid passing through her own swimsuit, and the girl covering up her... incident with some splashes of water.

Amelia's face burned with shame, remembering the accident, and how close she came to social disaster, but as she cut the footage of her own involvement (And the evidence of her own shameful spraying), she breathed a sigh of relief.

"Never falling for those stupid challenges of her site again.." she muttered to herself as she added a few finishing touches, and sent the video to Minnie's email, along with a message.

'Hey, when you find your phone, delete the video I sent, delete it, okay?'

A few minutes passed, before Amelia heard the ping of a message back from her friend.

'Kk~ tysm Ame! ❤️ '

Amelia let out another, drawn out sigh, before closing her computer, going about her nightly routine, and laying down to bed.

"Hopefully, class won't suck too hard tomorrow..."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Amidst talking about the results of midterms with her friend a few days later, Amelia finally brought the conversation back around to her friend's hobby.

"How'd that challenge thing go for you?" she asked, as Minnie grinned ear to ear.

"Oh, it was a hit on Tren-Door!" Minnie mused. "After I got my phone back, I checked up on the video during the midterm. Ten thousand hits! Mari-Star's gonna announce the winner of her challenge today!"

A ding rang out from her phone, and Minnie perked up.

"Ah, there it is! C'mon, let's watch!" she called, tapping the video.

'Hey everyone, It's Mari-star with the results of my Wet suit challenge!' The redhead's voice called out, looking chipper as before. 'We had quite a few challengers this time, but one of them stood head and shoulders above the others!'

Minnie seemed to practically vibrate in her seat, as Amelia pretended to pay attention.

'This spicy vixen was very nearly a late entry, but when you see the video, you'll understand why she's the winner.'

Minnie gave a goofy smile, as Amelia mentally chided the thought of Minnie ever being a 'Spicy Vixen'...

"More like, spacey.." she quipped as Minnie elbowed her sharply, as they kept watching.

'This college girl sure knows how to get wet, and get out with style..' Mari-Star kept calling. 'And with such a close call, such boldness had to be rewarded, you know?'

Amelia raised an eyebrow, getting a sudden sinking feeling in her gut, as the video continued.

'So, with over a hundred thousand views, everyone check out our winner! A bold, tanned, temptress, whose exhibitionism knows no bounds, and whose lust for danger almost matches her viewers!"

"No..." Amelia muttered, before the footage of her shaming right next to the fountain of classfolk, concealed only by Minnie's 'Accidental' splashing was then displayed on the feed, prompting that sinking feeling to magnify.

'Links in the description below, so you can see the video yourself! Remember to like, comment, and..'

"Minnie, i told you to delete that footage!" Amelia snapped at her friend, who had gone pale as a ghost, and whose face looked just as shocked.

"Am...Ame? I thought you didn't..Do these challenges..." she stammered, prompting a glare... Met with confusion.

"...D..Didn't you get my message to delete it?" she added, as Minnie nodded.

"Yeah, I trashed it as soon as I got my phone back." she called. "Honest! Ms. Kim told me someone had turned it in the other day, and the battery was nearly dead."

"Don't you lock your phone?!" Amelia snapped, as Minnie cowered a bit.

"Y..Yeah, of course I do..!" She stated, nervously. "And... I would never.... After all you do..."

Amelia glared at her friend for a few scant minutes, before glancing down at the link in the video, to the video's source. A few moments passed as the app loaded... Changing to an unfamiliar screenname.

'HeartilyOmorashi'

....

'That's not your screenname, is it..?" Amelia asked her friend sternly, as Minnie shook her head.

"No..! No, it's not.." she snapped. "Someone must have.... But... Who..."

The two girls puzzled this for what felt like a very, very long while, before Amelia's eyes glanced down to the view count, prompting her eyes to go wide.

"...T...Two freaking Million?! What?!" she snapped, as Minnie's eyes also widened in shock.

"Two...M...M..Million.."

Ba-bump...

That meant that that video had been seen two million times. Amelia didn't know how many of those were actual people, or just repeat spammers, but the thought of so many people, seeing her in such a compromised position...

Ba-bump...

Something about it scared her... But also.... Excited her?

'Pl..please, body... Don't tell me I'm excited by this..' she thought to herself incredulously, as her cheeks reddened up, and her face heated up.

No... She wasn't into.. that kind of thing...

...

W...Was she?
