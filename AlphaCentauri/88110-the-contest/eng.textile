Hi all.

This is a story that I began a while ago. Hopefully I can get it finished. 😉

Hi, I’m Dan, and I’m a superhuman.

Yeah, I know. Kinda dumb way to say it, kinda pretentious. But what can I say? I get a little kick out of the whole AA-style introduction, as if you all are going to say “Hi Dan,” and then I’ll say how long I’ve been clean for. And I sure as heck couldn’t say “I’m a superhero,” because I’m not. No costume, no cool name, no alter ego. Not to mention no public outcry, no PR issues, and no archvillains. Ain’t nobody got time for that.

But yeah, I have superpowers. Or, rather, a superpower. Basically, I can push thoughts into people’s heads. Think like Inception, only without the two hours of weird dream rules, awesome cinematography, and deep brass bwaaahs. More like that movie Push, if any of you have ever seen it. Actually, almost exactly like that. The main difference is that like Inception, a thought won’t always “take.” That’s why I work as a manager in a shoe store and live in an apartment with two other guys instead of just convincing everyone that they should give me whatever the heck I want until I live in my own mansion with my own cadre of hot girlfriends.

No, whenever I push a thought, it just appears in the person’s head, and they can second-guess it or ignore it like any other thought. It has to be something mild enough to potentially be true for them to accept it without getting suspicious. Not that their suspicions would land on me, of course. At least I hope. But I doubt anyone would jump to the conclusion “Dan has superpowers” before “I must be going crazy.”

So, the main things I tend to use my gift for are for avoiding minor inconveniences. I’ll push things like “he (me) was before me in line,” or “he (me again) already paid me that 20 he owed me,” or “it must be my turn to clean the bathroom.” If someone is already forgetful or just not focusing super hard, those kinds of thoughts tend to slip in unnoticed. Bigger things get filtered out. Inception was right about a thought needing to be in its simplest form for it to stick. Complicated thoughts get ignored in the same way weird dreams do, as just a bizarre production of the subconscious. Likewise, anything thought too specifically in my favor gets second-guessed and seen through.

Now, before you think of me as too much of a creep, you’ve gotta understand that it’s not like I use it constantly. First of all, like any skill, it takes some focus and some effort. Second, it’s not the kind of thing you just whip out all the time. Take lockpicking, for example. You think the guy that can pick locks is using that crap every chance he gets? No, of course not. And not just in case he gets caught, either. It’s just—there are some lines you won’t cross.

A conscience is a funny thing.

So, like any normal person, I tend to go as close to that line as I can. There are times, I admit, that I’ve crossed it and felt bad. And not just because I thought I might get caught, either. I’m not scared of that. It’s just the feeling that I went too far. You know?

Anyhow, for having a superpower, my life turned out way more boring than you’d expect. Having a relatively easy out for any real responsibility (I coasted through school by making my teachers think I had already turned in assignments I never bothered to do) just made me lazy, and ambitions of greatness never caught fire in me. Though it has been a kick to watch my roommates tear their hair out wondering how I’m so lucky with girls. Meanwhile I have to convince myself that my gift only smooths out the rough patches in relationships. It’s not as if I’m making anyone do something they don’t want to do already. It doesn’t work like that, I’m pretty sure.

The surprising uninterestingness of my life was changed when I met the others.

I first met them about eight months ago, I think. Athena was the first. Turns out, she can read minds, which made it easy for her to find other people with special abilities. Now, you might think that being around a mind reader would be a very uncomfortable experience, and you’d be right. Thankfully, by the time I met her, Athena had grown jaded enough with other people’s thoughts that she doesn’t really care anymore. Lucky for me. I wouldn’t want anyone to pay attention to my most depraved inner musings, especially a girl.

When you’re around her, though, it’s almost hard to think of Athena as a girl, at least in that way. Like, she definitely looks feminine enough, even attractive—short, and a little on the overweight side, but in a curvy way. No, it’s just that she tends to act so much like a guy, like, her mouth and mind can be just as filthy sometimes as the hairiest tattooed biker gang member you could imagine. Now, I know that a lot of guys think that a girl with a dirty mind would be a turn-on, but it’s not that way in person. At least, not for me. It ends up feeling more like hanging around with another dude, but one that’s kinda hot and you could theoretically bang, which just feels weird.

So, yeah, I met her first. She introduced herself to me as bluntly as an apathetic telepath would, and then later brought me to meet the other two at a pond they like to gather at. The shared bond of superpowers (and the relief of not having to hide them, most likely) made up the glue of their little circle, and it was apparently all that was necessary. Because other than that, they don’t really have anything in common.

First of the other two is Ray. Ray’s power is limited prescience, which means he knows what will happen shortly in the future. Now, depending on which movie you’re watching, this could either mean that it will definitely happen, or it could mean that you are now free to change that potential future. In Ray’s case, it means the latter. He can see how things will go if left to themselves, and then he can modify his actions to try to alter the outcome. It doesn’t mean he always can, but it does mean that he tends to be very lucky, at least to those who don’t know his secret. Seriously. Try beating him in a game of chess.

Whereas Athena is sarcastic and indifferent, a regular real-life Daria, Ray is loud and temperamental, with something of a sadistic streak. I wondered why anyone would want to hang out with someone like him when I first met him, and I still wonder it, after hanging out with him for the better part of a year. Like, really, he and Athena don’t make very good company. I guess it really is just the existence of our powers that connects us. Sometimes when around them, I’ve wondered: does having superpowers tend to make you a butthole? Also, would someone think the same thing about me if they met me?

And I haven’t even gotten to the last member of our little group. His name is, and I kid you not, (clears throat) Zenimeck 88 Oblique Transversal. Yeah. It’s ridiculous. We tend to just call him Zenny or Zen. He claims that he’s not from this planet (which would explain the stupid name), and as silly as it sounds, I believe him more often than not. It would certainly make sense, given his power. His ability is straight-up telekinesis. He can influence matter with his mind, though he can also use his hands to amplify it, Scarlet-Witch style. Only without the glowing red aura. Otherwise, he usually exudes an atmosphere of saturnine self-importance. Think the whole “alien civilization condescending to the puny humans” trope. All I can say is, if it’s an act, it’s a pretty dang good one.

Yeah, so when we meet together, it’s often more about us just shooting the breeze or getting food or whatever than anything actually relating to our superpowers. Sure, there have been the few joking references to “teaming up,” as well as bits of backstory or sharing times we’ve used our powers. We don’t really actually use them together. Not actively.

That all changed last week, though. We were down by the pond, as usual, eating some pizza we’d picked up, when Ray pointed off across the pond and said, with his mouth full of crust, “Check out that chick over there.”

Zenny and I both looked. Athena’s gaze didn’t shift from her phone. While Ray pointed out girls often enough—his “type” was basically anything with boobs—this one was noticeably walking stiffly but quickly and fidgeting before she disappeared into a store on the street across the pond. Ray spoke up again. “She probably has to pee pretty bad.” He chuckled, swallowed, and wiped his mouth before leaning back. “What is it with girls and having to go to the bathroom? There’s always a line going out the door. They must have tiny bladders or something.”

Athena, still focused on her phone, said, “That’s one of your stupider ideas, Ray.” It wasn’t unusual for her to respond to things that hadn’t actually been said yet.

To fill the rest of us in, Ray chuckled again and gave voice to what he had evidently been thinking. “I’ve got an idea. What if we had a little contest?”

While I leaned in closer, Athena merely rolled her eyes. “You’re a pig.” Zen showed no signs of even paying attention, but that was normal for him. I was curious, however. “What kind of contest?”

Ray looked over, grinning, with one eyebrow devilishly cocked and a malevolent glint in his eye. “Well, we’ve each got different powers, right? So, what if we had a contest with each other?”

“Right, what kind of contest?” My voice took on an irritated edge at having to repeat my question.

“It’s simple. We go to some kind of crowded area—like a mall or a park or something—and we set a time—like maybe two hours—and we try to see which of us can make the most chicks piss their pants?”

Athena didn’t react, since she already knew what Ray was going to say. Zenny, in what was for him a gratuitous display of emotion, arched a single eyebrow. But I started back, stunned. Was he serious? A quick glance at Athena’s unchanging expression confirmed that he was. It was a couple of seconds before I could respond at all, during which Ray just sat there, his stupid grin never faltering. Apparently he knew that we weren’t about to turn on him en masse.

At this point, Zen spoke up. “A contest of skill forcing girls to wet themselves seems rather fruitless.” (And yes, if you were wondering, that was a haiku. I forgot to mention it, but that’s another thing that makes me think he’s an alien—every time he talks, it’s in some kind of verse like that.)

Ray was undaunted. “Nah, it wouldn’t be for anything. Just for fun. Think about it. It’s not like we’d be doing anything illegal. And how often do you get to see a girl pee herself? I think it’d be pretty hot.”

I have to stop right here and say that I wanted to say something at that point. I really did. I wanted to object on some kind of principle, some reason why we shouldn’t go along with his insane idea. But the truth was, deep down inside, I admit I felt a sense of intrigue. I remembered an experience from when I was a kid, and a neighbor girl getting scared and saying something along the lines of “I almost wet myself,” and then imagining what it would’ve been like if she had. Even back then, it stirred something up inside me.

Athena heaved a deep sigh and crumpled the empty beer can she’d been holding. “You know what? Screw it. Sure, Ray, I’ll go along with your idiotic overcompensating contest. Whatever does it for you, I guess.”

Ray cackled and looked at Zenny, who merely gave a slow blink and cocked his head ever-so-slightly to the side. To us who knew him, that was confirmation enough, and now Ray’s overeager and somewhat fiendish smile was aimed at me, waiting to see if I was in or not.

I swallowed hard, my throat going dry. I wished the others hadn’t been so fine with his idea, that I wouldn’t be the only one to object. And at the same time, I still had a battle inside, the spark of morbid curiosity unable to be quenched. If I spoke up in protest now, Athena would already know that I actually wanted to try Ray’s idea, and wouldn’t that just make me a hypocrite? Plus, Ray’s face never changed. Did that mean he already knew that I was going to say yes? Did I even have a choice?

I cleared my throat, then replied, my voice cracking as I did so, “Okay. When will we do it?”
