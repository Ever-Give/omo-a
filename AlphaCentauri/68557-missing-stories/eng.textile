Missing stories?

So, there are several stories that I know I've read on here before, but now for the life of me, I can't find them. I'll list the ones I know of, but there may be more:

A story about the clanswomen of Ekpana --- I don't remember the title, but I could usually find it by searching "Ekpana"--now I get nothing.

The Virago Queen --- This was about the same characters as the story here: https://www.omorashi.org/topic/57223-the-conqueress-thunder-ft-art-by-livinginfinite/

, but it was a different story.

The Great Lord, part 2 --- This is the weirdest one to me, since the original thread still exists--but there used to be a second entry in that story which is now missing from the thread. https://www.omorashi.org/topic/33208-the-great-lord/

Anyone know what happened to these stories? The Wayback Machine doesn't seem to archive in enough detail for me to find them there.
