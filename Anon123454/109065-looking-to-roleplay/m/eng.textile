Looking to start an omorashi roleplay! Apologies for putting this in the fiction section, as the roleplay realm was shut down! I can do fandom characters and much prefer to! This is including but not limited to:

Marvel

Harry Potter

ASOIAF/Game Of Thrones

Various furry fandoms! (Zootopia,Beastars!)

Haikyuu/ MHA!

Voltron!

And much more, Just comment something that's not here and I can confirm if I've heard of it before!

I am looking to do primarily omorashi but am down for themes of romance and more if I like the pairing! Hard limits are padding and messing!
