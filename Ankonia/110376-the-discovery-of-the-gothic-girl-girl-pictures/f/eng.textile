Mary, with her short white hair that draped her face like a snow cloud, was a goth girl who attracted attention wherever she went. At twenty, she had already developed a taste for everything dark, mysterious and forbidden. Black was her color, tattoos her passion, and horror films her drug. That evening, however, boredom had wrapped her like a heavy blanket. Scrolling the web, she came across a film that promised to be one of the scariest ever. “Perfect,” she thought, with a mischievous smile. She prepared herself as if for a ritual: a giant bowl of chips, a two-liter bottle of Coke and the most comfortable sofa in the house. The room was bathed in soft light, only the computer screen illuminating her pale face and her curious eyes.

The film began with an eerie atmosphere, typical of psychological thrillers. Mary nibbled on her chips greedily, sipping her Coke nonstop. The tension in the room grew as fast as the tension on the screen. Her bladder, however, began to remind her that it wasn’t just the movie that was pressing. She bounced on the spot, trying to ignore the growing sensation, but fear and excitement were mixing in a dangerous cocktail.

Halfway through the movie, during a particularly intense scene, a jumpscare caught her by surprise. The scream that escaped her was muffled by the pillow, but her body reacted in a completely unexpected way. Her pee escaped, hot and unstoppable, wetting her gray leggings and half the couch. Mary stood still for a moment, her heart pounding. But instead of feeling embarrassed, she felt a strange wave of pleasure course through her body. The sensation of wetness between her legs, the heat spreading, was something she had never felt before.

With a furtive smile, Mary let herself go. With every jumpscare, every scene that made her jump, her bladder gave a little more. Her leggings were soaked through, clinging to her skin like a second skin. The contrast between fear and pleasure was electrifying. She felt alive, as if she had discovered a secret that only she could understand.

When the movie ended, the room was oppressively silent. Mary stood up, feeling the liquid slide down her legs. She should go to the bathroom, change, wash away the feeling. But the dark hallway, with the shadows dancing on the walls, was too scary. “Tomorrow,” she whispered to herself, heading for the bedroom.

The bed, with its white sheets and velvet pillows, was her safe haven. But that night, the nightmares inspired by the movie haunted her. She woke with a start several times, her heart in her throat, her bladder still giving out, creating yellow puddles on the sheets. The mattress got wet, the sheets stuck to her skin, but Mary felt no shame. In fact, every time she let go, she felt a shiver of pleasure run down her spine.

In the morning, sunlight filtered through the curtains, revealing the chaos of the night. Mary stretched, feeling the dampness between her legs and the weight of the wet sheets that were now pale yellow. But instead of feeling embarrassed, she smiled. That night had been a revelation. She had discovered a part of herself that she didn’t know existed, a hidden desire that made her even more fascinating in her own eyes.

She stood up, her leggings completely wet and smelly and sticking to her skin, and looked at herself in the mirror. Her eyes shone with a new light, as if she had found a secret treasure. “Who would have thought?” she murmured, touching her white hair. “The dark always hides the most interesting things.”

That night remained etched in her memory as a strangely unforgettable experience, a chapter of her life that she would jealously guard, knowing that it was only the beginning of a new, exciting adventure.
