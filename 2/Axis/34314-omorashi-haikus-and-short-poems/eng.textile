I thought it would be cool for people who don't have the time (like me) to write long stories or anything like that to write short poems or haikus featuring omo so they can still give to the community without breaking up their busy schedule to do it. So, feel free to add to this thread! I'd really like to see it blossom and I'm sure I'm not the only one.

Allow me to start things off:

Streaking down her legs

Filling up her socks and shoes

It's snowing on Mt. Fuji

(I'm sorry I had to)

I apologize in advance if something like this already exists or if this should have been in a different section.
