A parody of one of Yun Jin's hangout events, the one where she gives you an acting lesson. I surprised myself with how quickly I churned this out. I definitely stayed up too late a couple nights working on it but only took me four days.

This is one of the ideas I came up with several months ago, I shelved it because I was working on the monstrosity known as "Only Kittens Wet Themselves, Right?". I am happy to announce it has finally been brought back into the light and is completed, enjoy!
