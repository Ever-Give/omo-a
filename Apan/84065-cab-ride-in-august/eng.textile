This is the best story I have ever read in my entire life. I’m absolutely floored by this and so blown away at the skill you have at writing. Honest to god, I will willingly pay you to rewrite the ending in a copy of where the door is locked at the end and you know what happens. Hope this message finds you well, you are talented. If you’re interested, I’d be over the moon🫂💙 Thank you for writing such a mythical-tier masterpiece of a story.🥲

Wow, thanks for that blast of a feedback! You know, I would give an arm and a leg to read that same story written by someone else, but with that certain other ending as well. When it comes to reading stories, the full-blown accident for an ending is the only thing I care for, but when writing something myself, I no longer see any reason to go there. On the other hand, I'm definitely not going to stop anyone else who might want to have a go.
