So, my never-ceasing desire to harvest'n hoard whatever the female desperation trope can throw at me in terms of stories and accounts finally led me down the precarious path of bottery (I made that word up, and I didn't even use AI). Obviously, I'm late to the game as there have been numerous stories posted on this forum alone generated through the ChatGPT interface (and possibly others?), and I've gotta admit, I'm not that impressed. The nuances of authentic, meaningful text will in my opinion be one of the last frontiers to be conquered by even the cleverest of algorithms and I didn't have to venture far in my attempts with said bot in order for that to be painfully obvious. I don't see human creativity becoming superflous anytime soon unless we really lower our standards. That said, I did manage to squeeze out at least one more or less convincing story out of it though, and that's the one I'm here to share with you all.

What I did was initially asking it to come up with the general premise of the story and then query it about each specific moment therein, and finally arranging it all in order to fit the storyline. I made a special point of feeding it as sparsely detailed queries as possible while obviously steering it in the 'right' direction. You'd be surprised to find how many of the suspiciously specific details herein were actually generated by the AI, seemingly independent of my input; that to me was the most impressive part. I also made a point of not adding any new content to the output when editing it all together, not even single words.

There are some truncation of phrases though, since it tended to repeat itself as it ran out of things to say. All in all, it turned out not half-bad although it's still somewhat iffy and sorely lacking in detail in places, but I've read far worse post written by actual human beings, so count me fairly satisfied in the end. I'm probably not going to utilize it again anytime soon, but you've got to try everything at least once, right?

Sarah's date distaster

Sarah and Jack were both looking forward to their first date, they had met online and had hit it off right away. They had decided to go to the movies, Sarah was feeling a bit nervous but excited to finally meet Jack in person. She had spent some time picking her outfit. She had chosen a red suspender dress that she felt complemented her figure nicely. She paired it with a red and white gingham shirt, unbuttoned collar underneath, a pair of white tights and black heels. She wanted to look her best but also feel comfortable.

Before the movie, Jack and Sarah met at a park near the theater. Jack was a bit nervous, but Sarah was visibly more nervous, but Jack did not notice it. They walked around the park, chatting and laughing. They talked about their favorite movies and TV shows, and Jack couldn't help but notice how beautiful Sarah looked in the warm afternoon light. They sat on a bench by a pond and Jack told her about his love for fishing and how peaceful it was to sit by the water and just relax. Sarah listened intently, thinking that Jack is such a nice guy and he is really making an effort to make her feel comfortable and have a good time.

As they walked to the theater, Sarah was already feeling the urge to use the restroom. She had been holding it in for a while, but Sarah's urgency continued to increase. She was thinking about finding a restroom before the movie, but she was also worried about bringing it up to Jack and potentially ruining the date. She didn't want to seem desperate or rude, so she kept it to herself.

As they walked towards the theater, Jack took Sarah's hand and she felt her heart skip a beat. They chatted and laughed as they walked, but Sarah's discomfort was growing with each step. She was trying to hold it in, but the thought of not finding a restroom before the movie was making her anxious. She tried to distract herself by chatting with Jack and focusing on the movie they were about to see, but it was becoming increasingly difficult to ignore.

Once they arrived at the theater, Sarah was relieved to find a restroom but the queue was too long. She didn't want to hold Jack up, so she decided to wait until after the movie. They bought their tickets and grabbed some snacks before heading into the theater. Sarah was really excited, but she was also getting more and more desperate for the bathroom. But she didn't want to ruin the moment by bringing it up, so she kept quiet and hoped she could hold it until the movie was over.

As they settled into their seats, she realized that she needed to use the bathroom. But, she was too shy to say anything, and thought she could hold it until the movie was over. Sarah tried to focus on the movie and enjoy the moment, but her desperation for the bathroom was growing stronger. She kept shifting in her seat and crossing her legs tightly, trying to hold it in. She was also trying to make sure that Jack couldn't see how uncomfortable she was.

As the movie played on, Sarah's desperation grew, but she tried to hide it, crossing her legs tightly and shifting in her seat. Sarah's mind started to wander and she couldn't focus on the plot. All she could think about was finding a bathroom. She kept looking around the theater, hoping to spot a sign for the bathroom, but she couldn't see one. At one point, Jack turned to her and asked if she was ok, but Sarah just smiled and said she was fine, not wanting to ruin the date by bringing up her bathroom issues. Jack noticed that she was a bit tense but didn't know what was the reason.

As the movie came to an end, Sarah knew she was running out of time and was getting more and more panicked. She tried to hold on until the credits were over. She had to tell Jack what was going on but after the movie was finished, Sarah was still too shy to mention her need for the bathroom to Jack. They were still seated in the movie theater, and she was trying to hold it in as they waited for the other movie-goers to leave the theater.

As they got up to leave, she was looking around for a toilet to sneak away but the bathroom inside the movie theater was closed, but there were no queues to the toilets in the lobby. She could have used the restroom at that moment, but she was too shy to mention it to Jack and didn't want to ruin the moment by bringing it up.

She followed Jack out of the theater but her urgency was growing stronger, and it was getting harder for her to hold on. Sarah was still too shy to mention her need for the bathroom to Jack. She was trying to hold it in as they left the theater, but her desperation was growing. Jack suggested they grab a coffee at a nearby cafe and they quickly walked there. On their way to the cafe, she kept looking around for a toilet to sneak away. They passed a public restroom located in a park, but unfortunately, it was closed. Sarah saw it and felt a wave of disappointment, but didn't mention it to Jack.

As they continued walking towards the cafe, Sarah kept looking around for a bathroom. Jack could see that Sarah was becoming more and more uncomfortable but didn't know the reason. Sarah was too shy to mention her need. They walked past a few more public restrooms on the way, but Sarah didn't want to raise Jack's suspicion, so she had to be subtle about it.

As Sarah and Jack walked by a 7-11, Sarah noticed the store and was desperate to find a restroom. Her urgency was increasing with each step. She was looking around for a place to use the restroom, and when she spotted the 7-11 store, she felt a glimmer of hope. She was trying to find a way to bring it up to Jack without sounding too desperate, but her shyness made it difficult for her to speak up.

As they passed by the store, Sarah tried to look inside, hoping to find a restroom sign. But as she peered inside, she noticed that the store didn't have a restroom sign and she felt disappointed and frustrated. Jack saw her disappointment and asked what was wrong, but she was too shy to tell him the truth. She just brushed it off and they continued on their way to the cafe. The incident at the 7-11 only added to her discomfort and urgency, making an accident more difficult to avoid.

As they walked past a gas station, Sarah casually mentioned that she needed to buy something from the convenience store and asked Jack to wait for her outside while she went in. She walked into the store and quickly made her way to the restroom, but when she saw the "closed for repairs" sign, she felt her heart sink. She was getting more and more desperate, but didn't want to raise Jack's suspicion.

Sarah then approached the attendant and asked if the restroom was available, the attendant replied that it was out of order. Sarah thanked the attendant and pretended to buy something and came out with a discouraged expression on her face, Jack didn't notice anything unusual.

She was trying to think of a way to excuse herself to use the restroom, but with every closed or occupied bathroom they passed, her options were becoming limited. As they continued walking towards the cafe, they did not pass any other bathroom on their way. She couldn't find an opportunity to use the restroom before they reached the cafe. Sarah was getting more and more desperate, but still couldn't bring herself to mention it to Jack. She was trying to hold on as long as she could, but it was getting harder and harder. Her mind was racing and she didn't know what to do. She was too embarrassed to tell Jack what was happening and too desperate to hold on much longer.

As Sarah and Jack approached the cafe, Sarah's urgency had reached its peak. She was trying to hold it in as much as possible, but she knew it was only a matter of time before she would no longer be able to do so. The thought of finally being able to use the restroom was overwhelming, she could feel the relief in her mind. She was trying to focus on the cafe, and when they finally reached it, she felt hopeful.

When they reached the cafe, Sarah was visibly panicked. She was on the brink of tears and her desperation was at an all-time high. She saw the bathroom sign, but when she tried to go in, it was locked. She turned to Jack and said "It's locked, what am I going to do?" Jack could see that she was on the verge of tears and knew she needed to use the bathroom urgently. He finally became aware of her urgency at that moment and he could see how much discomfort and embarrassment she was going through.

He tried to look for another solution, and immediately went to the staff and asked if there was another bathroom available or if they could open the locked restroom for Sarah's urgent need. The staff member apologized and informed him that the restroom was closed for cleaning. As they stood before the employee, Sarah was visibly panicked and her face was flushed. She was shifting her weight from one foot to another, crossing her legs tightly and trying to hide her discomfort. The employee could see that she was in a state of distress and Jack quickly explained the urgency of the situation and begged the employee to let Sarah use the restroom.

But it was too late, Sarah's urgency had reached a critical point and she couldn't hold it any longer. As she desperately tried to hold it, the employee could see the wetness seeping through her dress and the puddle forming on the floor. The staff member offered to let Sarah use the employee restroom. Jack quickly thanked the staff member and led Sarah to the employee restroom as quickly as possible, as it was the only option available for her. Her steps were unsteady as her tights were wet and slippery, her dress was clinging to her legs.

She ran off trying to reach the restroom, but it was too late, she had an accident right there in front of everyone. She was trying to hold on to her clothes, crossing her legs and trying to hide the wetness but she wet herself before reaching the restroom. The wetness was visibly noticeable and the odor was strong. The other customers present in the cafe noticed Sarah's wet clothes and the puddle forming on the floor, they noticed the smell and heard the commotion caused by Jack and the employee.

Jack felt devastated and mortified for Sarah, and Sarah was too embarrassed to even look at him. She quickly rushed out of the cafe, not knowing what to do. Her first date ended in disaster and she didn't know if she would ever be able to face Jack again.

The AI has definitely gotten pretty impressive and this probably the best one I've seen, but it does still have a bit of a robotic tone. I do really like the idea of using AI to decide what's going to happen to a character next though, almost like an interactive story.

}}

Yeah, there's something about the "tone" (for the want of a better word when describing text) that gives it away that this wasn't conceived of by a human being. Sometimes it feels almost like it's going through bullet points or simply is inserting phrases that it has learned is supposed to be featured in desperation stories just for the sake of it (which is essentially what it has done after all).

It has to be emphasized also, that this is the result of repeating of enquiries in certain places in order to render it plausible. It wouldn't have been half as impressive had I stuck with what it spat out on every first attempt to fish for more details. But when it got it "right" (right is in the eyes of the beholder, after all), it was quite thrilling to follow what would happen to the poor girl, like you said, almost an interactive story, a story-on-demand so to speak.

That'll be the day when it suffices to simply ask it "Write a long story about a shy girl who gets desperate during her first date and may or may not be able to reach a toilet in time", with no need for adjustments afterwards. I hereby make a solemn vow to post that story if we ever reach that point in the AI evolution!

I have to say it's kind of impressive what it can do. It definitely has an odd bit of transition and repetition and even if you hadn't told us it was a generated story something would definitely feel a bit "off" I think. As someone who enjoys both reading and writing I don't love what this might portend for the future but as a pure achievement it is impressive. Thanks for sharing.

I'm personally not that worried that AI might obliterate the line between what's created and what's generated, what I'm worried about is people buying into that notion. There are pretty deep philosophical implications overall that warrants discussions but this isn't the right forum for it. Suffice it to say that there is something to be said about form and substance, and that an AI by definition only ever will be able to recreate the former in my opinion which is why I don't see AI:s ever being creative in a meaningful way, including storytelling.

Thank you, I love the scenario of a girl being to shy to admit her desperate need and trying to conceal it

}}

Yes, shyness and trying to hide the need or refusing to admit it has always been a thing for me too.

Likewise for me, hence me trying to tame the AI to generate something along those lines. I'd love to see more actual such stories on here.
