Instead of being productive and ending my main project, I started this. A lot of it is setup but there will be more parts. This takes place at about the same time as where I am with Chib. I wanted to see what Millie being directly involved would look like since she's ace, but she's more sex-positive than Rabb is. Also no art for this part: I didn't think I'd get done with it today.

###

Part 1

Millie hauled her knapsack down the enclosed boarding ramp from the ferry at the tail end of her group, covered in dirt and sore from the tumultuous boat ride. For the past eight days, she'd been staying at the campsite on Blue Island, near a site her archaeology group was excavating.

The Talon Islands, an archipelago in the far south of the Grisderm Homeworld named for its shape on maps, were prone to near-constant hostile stormy weather for more than eight months out of the year. Even during the calmer summer season, there were at least one or two major storms. This storm, Millie recalled, was already forecasted to last for several days despite the calm, relatively warm weather that preceded its sudden onset.

An aroma of convenience store pizza distracted Millie from the wall monitors showing the weather conditions, canceled departures, and postponed arrivals. Even if the pizza tasted vaguely freezer-burned and had a texture like elephant skin after hours in the hot case, it sounded fantastic to Millie, who'd eaten only rehydrated oatmeal, apple sauce, and instant coffee for the past week at the campsite.

Millie heaved her knapsack onto her shoulder and crossed the terminal area to the little alcove containing the cafe. She hauled her pack into the cafe, ordered a surprisingly fresh-looking personal pizza with a soft drink, and tottered to the dining area, where she set her pack on the chair next to hers. Millie sat back and opened her phone before she started eating, and called her daughter.

Millie was a petite Haman woman but looked about twice her size in her layers of clothing. She wore a faded gray City of Rain University sweater, emblazoned with the letters "CRU," mud-smeared blue jeans, and a pair of dirt-caked hiking boots over full thermals and two shirts. A bright orange knit cap sat over her hair, which was chestnut brown and braided halfway down her back. Her pointed ears stuck out slightly and matched the pink blush across her nose and cheekbones. As the phone rang, Millie picked up her drink and took a sip, leaving dirt behind in the condensation on the cup. She used a napkin to wipe it off and glanced around for a place to wash her hands.

Millie's daughter Chrysanthemum answered the phone. Chrysanthemum, known to her parents as "Mums," was on break at school and had signed on to stay in her dormitory to finish an interworld history project. Millie checked in with her and asked how the project was going, receiving a vague teenage response that it was going alright.

"Dad called too," Mums yawned. "He arrived about three hours ago." The terminal's clock showed that it was half past nine in the morning, and Millie realized after some mental math that it would be past midnight in the City of Rain. Millie apologized for calling so late and Mums took the apology more dutifully than Millie was comfortable with. Millie filed that away in her mind after they ended the conversation: she spied a handwash station in the back corner of the cafe, stood up, and hurried over.

While Millie washed her hands, she ran into another of the university instructors supervising their group on Blue Island, an older Grisderm with a long and complicated Grisderm name, shortened to Obi for convenience. Obi wore an insulated full-body suit like those worn by the local Grisderm fishers with a plain gray headscarf and gaiter, and their scaly face had an unusual reddish tint. There were three sinks and Obi stepped up to the sink next to Millie's. The two of them exchanged a nod.

"The power's out in half the Lodge," Obi informed Millie. "The clerk told me it happened not long before we arrived. The students and other instructors are doubling up and sleeping on couches."

"Have you doubled up yet?" Millie asked.

Obi nodded. "My room has power. Kiki's staying with me."

Obi was only there for tea and sat with Millie, discussing the weather forecast for the next few days until Keyana "Kiki" Moss, another of the CRU faculty chaperones, approached. They exchanged a brief greeting and Obi and Kiki left, saying goodnight to Millie.

Millie finished her pizza, and since her drink came with a free refill, she got one before she headed for the front desk of the Lodge.

The City of Last Resort's ferry terminal had an attached hotel, three restaurants, a fishing supply store, and an optimistic little souvenir shop. The hotel was called "The Lodge." The Lodge's check-in desk was only a short walk from the cafe, and Millie saw with some satisfaction that she'd waited out the line. She was able to walk right up without a wait.

"Good evening, Sai," Millie said to the desk clerk in what she hoped was a formal tone. She was exhausted, but the tone was custom there. It must have passed muster because the clerk acknowledged her with a small nod. "Do you still have a room for a Millicent Lee with the CRU?"

The clerk, a young Grisderm woman in a dark green uniform body suit, told Millie that her formerly reserved room was in the part of the lodge without power.

"The rooms that have power are full, and the ones without cannot be rented, Sai Lee," the young woman said, looking harried despite herself. "I apologize."

Millie said she understood and would make some calls: she was part of a large group, and she didn't mind sharing a couch bed if she had to. The lodge's lobby had a small sitting area, where Millie dropped her pack before plopping down in one of the lobby armchairs. She took a moment to rest and sip her drink while she thought of who to call first when someone walked up and stood beside her.

"Hey, Mills. Obi said you were out here," said an Andyne man. He looked tall from where Millie sat, and she knew he was about a head taller than she. The man wore a set of CRU sweats and had a fading tan to his pale skin, short curly light blue hair, blunt-shaped feathered bluejay wings, and his most striking feature, his pupilless amber eyes. They made the man, Digitalis, look a little spooky, but Millie knew better: he was her former husband and one of the least spooky people she knew.

"Hi, Digit," Millie yawned. "Do you and Arthur have anyone sleeping on your couch?"

"I came over to ask you about that, actually," said Digitalis. "You're welcome to stay with us." Millie stood up to shoulder her heavy pack for what she hoped would be the last time that day, but Digitalis was already lifting it. He made it look light and insisted on carrying it to the hotel room. One of the three diverging hallways had been blocked off using stanchions from the ferry terminal, and on the wall between the remaining two was a stack of plastic bins full of small hotel bottles. Millie and Digitalis passed close, and Millie saw that the bottles were shampoo, conditioner, lotion, body wash, liquid soap, and bubble bath.

"What time did you leave the campsite?" Digitalis yawned. The windows they passed were gray and ominously dark for mid-morning on a summer day, and either showed an expanse of turbulent water or the moored ferries, everything on their decks tied down.

"Seven. We were up all night packing up camp before the storm hit," yawned Millie. "Obi and I discussed cutting off the trip right here, but we'll have to bring that up with the other instructors. Whatever happens, we'll be in the Lodge for a few days, so we'll have plenty of time for that."

"Millie! Hi!" said Arthur. He sat on the couch with a cup of tea in front of the room's television, which was muted and tuned to a documentary on what appeared to be an old Haman castle. "How's the excavation going?"

"Not great. We've found nothing but roots, rocks, modern garbage, more rocks, and dirt, and we've tried three different sites," Millie answered. Digitalis set her pack on a folding luggage rack and she thanked him. "We might just end the excavation and take the next ferry north once the storm ends," she added to Arthur. "We'll probably meet or do a conference call with the other instructors sometime tomorrow to discuss the matter."

After that, Millie asked about taking a shower. She excavated her shower things from her pack and Digitalis led her into the bathroom to explain the shower's controls. Digitalis and Arthur's room was a prefabricated modular unit, typical of Grisderm construction, with a spacious Andyne bathroom. The shower took up about half the room, with a retractable clear glass screen. There was a circular bathtub in the back corner of the shower floor, the tile cover almost indistinguishable when it was in place.

"The glass in these screens is cool," said Digitalis, pushing a small button on the edge of the shower screen. It went blinding white and opaque in a blink. Digitalis pushed the button again and the white was replaced with gently undulating blue waves, dark heather gray, and matte black. "There's a color dial in the light switch, but I haven't messed with that yet. It's also double-sided." He demonstrated this by having Milie walk in the shower and look out. The glass had been opaque black from the outside, but inside she had a clear view of the bathroom and Digitalis with a slight purplish tint. He switched the glass back to full transparency and the tint winked out.

"So I just need to make sure the outer panel is opaque," Millie mused.

Digitalis said, "I'll let you get to your shower. I'm going to the vending room for some emotional support carbs. Would you like anything?"

The shower started as Digitalis walked out the door. Millie washed off the accumulated dirt and gloried in the hot water. Now that she was naked, Millie could get a good look at the bruises on her hips and thighs from a rock that had poked through her thin sleeping pad no matter what she tried to put between her and it. She thought longingly of the couch bed.

"Millie?" Arthur called through the bathroom door.

"What's up, Arty?" replied Millie.

"Would you mind if I came in to brush my teeth? I'll be quick."

Millie leaned out of the shower to make sure the screen was still opaque from the outside. It was. "Sure! Take your time - I'd love an excuse to stay in the hot water longer."

Arthur entered the bathroom. His normally sleek black-feathered wings were rumpled from the cramped seats on the long bus ride to the Lodge. He wore his long dark hair in its usual side clip and a terrycloth robe over a pair of loud striped pants.

"Those pants are new," Milly commented while Arthur opened and sniffed the hotel toothpaste. "Nice pattern." Arthur turned to the screen. His eyes swept over it, briefly giving Millie the impression of making eye contact.

"Can you see me?" Arthur asked slowly.

"Yeah, it's double-sided," said Millie. "She pushed the button Digitalis had shown her and peeked out to watch the glass change to the water pattern. Arthur made a noise that might've been, "That's cool!" around his toothbrush.

Arthur stepped over to the sink to finish brushing. "Digit and I were planning on a nap. The last leg of the trip here was eleven hours and we're exhausted."

"I was going to ask if I could fold out the couch bed for a late morning nap myself," said Millie. "But isn't Digit getting food?"

"He's getting it now to beat the lunch rush later," said Arthur. "I could fold out the bed if you like." Millie accepted the offer and when she emerged in her clean sleep sweats, the couch bed was neatly made. Digitalis had returned and retired to the bedroom with Arthur for their nap. Millie turned down the lights, switched off the television, and flopped down onto the mattress.

Millie swam up out of a heavy sleep that left her headachy and fuzzy. She'd fallen asleep in the same position she'd bellyflopped onto the mattress in and sat up massaging her neck. Her throat was so dry that she could feel the sides sticking together when she swallowed. It didn't hurt, but she found it annoying and got up to grab her drink from the cafe.

The room's refrigerator sat across the room from the couch next to the television. Millie retrieved her soda and slowly drank the whole thing, blessing her past self for remembering the free refill. The cup was good for cheap refills at the cafe if she kept it, so she put it back in the refrigerator with the remaining ice in the bottom. As soon as Millie stood up from closing the fridge, a brief but intense urge to pee hit her. She padded briskly over to the bathroom.

The bathroom door stood open when Millie reached it, and she didn't bother with the lights. Weak daylight filtered in from the high horizontal windows and gave her more than enough to see by. Rain clattered and splashed loudly against the windows, making Millie's bladder throb dully.

"B-bear," said a small voice. It took Millie a few seconds to distinguish it from the background noise. "I think I heard something."

Halfway to the toilet, Millie turned. The shower screen was clear, and she saw Digitalis behind it, standing naked by the shower wall and holding onto the support bars next to the showerhead. What Millie first thought was his shadow was Arthur's wing: Arthur was kneeling between Digitalis's legs. Millie couldn't see exactly what he was doing behind the edge of Digitalis's wing, but she could hear some of it, along with Arthur's contented little grunts. The white stripes on Digitalis's wings stood out, ghostly and violet-tinted behind the glass.

Millie froze. Digitalis looked in her direction. Millie's first impulse was to skitter out, apologizing profusely, and wait until Arthur and Digitalis finished. She waved sheepishly, but neither Arthur nor Digitalis seemed to see her.

Another urge to pee hit Millie and this time it wasn't brief. Millie had to clamp down hard and press her legs together. It took a momentous effort and holding it in was almost painful, but she somehow rode it out with only a brief bloom of warmth in her underwear before the urge eased. When she looked back up, Digitalis had pulled back from Arthur and cautiously approached the screen. Millie saw that Digit's cock was fully erect, and recognized a full bulge in his lower belly. It gave Millie butterflies in her stomach but she suppressed them: Digitalis wasn't her husband anymore and she didn't feel it would be appropriate. Not without an invitation, anyway.

"Mills?" Digitalis said tentatively. He reached the edge of the screen and peered out.

Millie raised her hand in greeting, aware that she was shaking, and gulped, "Hi, Digit." Digitalis pushed a button on the side of the screen and the purple tint in the glass blinked out.

Arthur's eyes found Millie, and he said, "Hi, Millie!"

Millie crossed her legs. "Hi, Arthur. I wouldn't disturb you normally, but I've really gotta pee."

"You're not disturbing us," said Arthur. "Care to join us? When you have to go it's no joke."

"What's that supposed to mean?" Millie snorted despite herself.

Blushing, Digitalis said, "You have a large bladder. I second Bear's invitation to pee on us, but if you don't want to, that's okay too."

Millie's vulva quivered and let out another drip of warmth. "We'll have to do it right now. I can't hold it any longer," she said, dropping her pants.

"Can you do that thing where you stick out your hips for distance?" Arthur asked giddily. Millie shuffled toward Arthur, but Digitalis went toward the back corner of the shower, bent down, and started feeling around on the floor tiles.

"Digit, what are you doing?" Arthur asked, perplexed while Millie bounced desperately on her feet. A small squirt escaped her. She opened her mouth to tell Arthur about the sunken bathtub, but a small, whining groan came out instead.

Digitalis lifted a half moon of floor and pulled it back. The scuzzy light from outside brightened, illuminating Digitalis as he fully uncovered the circular bathtub set into the floor.

Arthur gasped, "We've had a bathtub this whole time?" and guided Millie around the tub. With Arthur standing up, it was hard, pun intended, to ignore how large his erection was.

Digitalis sat on the side of the bathtub where the rim curved away from the wall, one leg in the tub and the other laid flat along the tiled rim. Arthur stepped down into the tub and settled between Digitalis's thighs. Millie approached the side of the tub, standing perpendicular to Arthur and Digitalis. As requested, Millie angled her hips. The first burst took a few seconds to pick up speed, gently showering Digitalis and Arthur until Mille bore down. Her flow tightened into a stream and shot against the shower wall in a high arch. Millie still had a low headache, so she only pushed for a few seconds, letting the arch fall back into a lazy spray.

"Phew," Millie sighed, watching Arthur cheerfully suck her former husband's dick. Digitalis was enjoying himself too, flexing his wings against the wall and undulating his hips slightly with his eyes half-open and unfocused. Millie squatted next to him at the side of the tub, finishing at a leisurely dribble on the tile floor. "Looks like somebody's getting close."

Digitalis's strange eyes turned to Millie. "Y-...Yeah," he gasped, jerking forward. Arthur reached up and steadied him with a hand in the middle of his chest. Millie leaned forward and kissed Digitalis's temple near his hairline. Her hand explored down to his nipple, rubbing it in slow circles the way Millie knew he liked, and she felt a cooling drop of her own urine on his skin. Digitalis leaned into Millie's kisses and wedged his wings tightly against the wall, small moans escaping between his rapid breaths.

Arthur sat back and finished Digitalis off with his hand, letting Digitalis's fluids spatter on his chin, chest, and belly.

"Wow, Digit," snorted Arthur. Digitalis arched his back and let out another drip of cum onto Arthur's knees before he relaxed in Millie's arms. Digitalis placed a hand on Arthur's to signal him to stop and he did, leaning on Digitalis's thigh.

"We should..." Digitalis panted, his breath hot against Millie's shoulder. "We should do this again."

"Would you be up for oral, Millie?" asked Arthur, leaning back and letting his cock stand up, twitching in the air.

"I'm...okay. But thanks for the offer," said Millie, helping Digitalis sit up. His lower belly bulged more than ever, and Millie was surprised he wasn't leaking.

Arthur scooted a little closer to Digitalis. "It's always open if you change your mind."

"Are you going to urinate on Arty?" Millie asked Digitalis. Digitalis gave an affirmative grunt, reaching down. "Can I help?"

Digitalis sat back against the wall and stretched his wings slowly. "Is it okay with you, Bear?"

"Please do," purred Arthur.

Millie gently grasped Digitalis's member and aimed squarely at Arthur's exposed glans. Digitalis let go with a little shiver and relaxed against Millie. The stream hit its mark and Arthur moaned under his breath.

"I see you've been holding it, Digit," Millie observed.

Arthur replied, slowly but steadily stroking himself: "He's been holding it since before we left. This-...no, it's yesterday now."

"I didn't have time with all the packing," sighed Digitalis. "Neither of us did."

Millie looked Arthur up and down. Arthur's strokes were quickening. "When did you pee, then, Arty?"

Arthur tried and failed at a cheeky tone. "H-how did you know?" he gasped. Digitalis's urine splashed down one of the hidden drains in the tub.

"You walk a certain way when you have to go," said Millie. "You've been walking normally since I showed up, so I assume you relieved yourself somewhere en route, or here." She aimed the stream up and down Arthur's shaft. He was beginning to twitch.

"How do you know that though?" Digitalis asked. "Have you two had a rendezvous?"

"No," Millie said. In the tub, Arthur's hand was a blur. "Arty and I are just bathroom buddies on remote digs."

"I thought bathroom buddies were supposed to be same-sex," said Digitalis curiously. His flow slowed and Millie angled it upward to keep it on the mark.

"They are-" Millie paused to lean back. Arthur came in several large bursts, aiming forward at the side of the bathtub. Some of it hit Digitalis's legs and Millie felt some on the hand still holding Digitalis's penis. The rest dripped out on the tiles, draining with Digitalis's urine. He finished, and Millie shook him off.

Panting, Arthur scooted back again and rested on the curved side of the tub. "Millie's just the only one who-" Arthur gulped and paused to catch his breath while Millie stood up and stretched.

"People used to complain that Arty takes too long to pee," Millie filled in, grunting as she stretched her legs and back. "I don't mind waiting the extra minute or two. It's a nice break from digging and hauling dirt. If you like, I can tell you about how we became bathroom buddies later."

The bathtub was quick to clean up, and Millie threw on a hotel bathrobe to retrieve some bottles of bubble bath from the bin in the hotel lobby. Millie and Arthur opened and emptied ten of the small bottles into the bathwater while Digitalis prepared their lunches in the living area's microwave.

I swear I'm still working on Chib. Part 80 is edited but the motivation to do the art to go with the chapter is lacking. In lieu of art for this chapter of this story is a small glossary:

Andyne: people with bird wings who like flower and animal names and have a really socially restrictive culture

Grisderm: semi-reptilians with large eyes, look sort of like aliens, have a matrilineal society, and the males are the ones who give birth

Haman: basically anime elf people with pointy ears. Pink and green are common hair colors and mainstream Haman culture has a rigid religious caste structure

Human: magical creatures that are sometimes bred for various physical traits including psychic abilities, unusual coloration, futanari/unusual genital configurations, and desired personality traits

Renoige: cat people who have a sharp sense of smell. Scents and marking things with urine is part of every Renoige culture, and the ladies have pseudopenis clitorises like those of hyenas

An Unexpected Guest Part 2

"It's perfect," said Millie.

Arthur brushed the top of the bubbles with his hand to level them out. "Do you think we used too much bubble bath?"

Millie and Arthur stood side by side in the wide andyne shower. A tiled bathtub was sunk into the floor in the back corner. Over its rounded sides, a gleaming mass of bubbles rose slowly past Millie's knee height in a cylindrical shape, dented slightly in the back where the faucets sat.

Millie shrugged and replied, "Maybe. I don't think we can eat in the bath without getting bubbles in our food." The lights were on in the bathroom, and she wore a fluffy light blue hotel bathrobe. Arthur was naked, his olive complexion a little paler than usual under his dark freckles: it was currently mid-winter in the City of Rain, where Millie, Digitalis, and Arthur lived. Millie was shorter than Arthur; he was more than a head taller than she was, with the top of her head only reaching his clavicles. Both wore their hair down, her waist-length brown hair straight and his similarly waist-length hair dark and curly.

"I'm content sitting on the floor to eat," said Arthur. "Under other circumstances, I'd be sitting on the ground to eat for a week two days from now." He bent down and sat on the warm tile next to the tub, not bothering to cover himself.

Digitalis peeked into the bathroom. Like Millie and Arthur, he was naked. "Food is almost done. Where are we eating?"

"In here, I think," said Millie. "I'll get the table." She left the bathroom and came back carrying an adjustable folding table. While she did that, Arthur stood up and retrieved the drinks Digitalis had gotten from the vending room.

"I got a text from Dr. Moss," said Arthur, waiting for Millie to set the table upright before putting the drinks down. "She seems to think Blue Island is a waste of time too."

Millie nodded and said, "It may be a waste of time, but we won't know that until we can print out the Geofizz results in the City of Stone. Otherwise, all we've found is modern detritus. We'll have to discuss leaving with the other instructors, though."

Arthur sighed, "True." He took a long drink from the one-liter bottle of spiced andyne tea that Digitalis had gotten him. It smelled warm and pleasant, and Millie made a mental note to get that tea the next time she went to the vending room. The tea was a concentrate, and Arthur drank it at full strength.

"Did they not have your usual brand of green tea?" asked Millie. "Or was it sold out because there are only two vending rooms with power?"

Still drinking, Arthur held up a hand to tell her it would take him a second when Digitalis entered, carrying a tray he'd brought from the vending room. Vending room food was packaged to stack neatly, and Digitalis balanced it as he crossed the room and set the tray on the table.

"Bear requested something stronger," said Digitalis. "He tried a new brand of soda at one of the waypoints late last night and the taste is sticking in his mouth."

"It was awful," Arthur sputtered. "The tea seems to be working though."

The overhead speakers chimed and a cool voice of nondescript gender announced, "Now approaching Transportation Waypoint 147B-A. Amenities available."

Arthur's bladder was almost full, but he didn't pay any mind. He'd held more for longer and there was no danger of him losing control and wetting himself.

Across the small compartment, Digitalis stretched his wings slowly and carefully. It felt even smaller with the blinds down: a bulky accordion shade covered the window, shutting out the fog-shrouded grayness of the coastline. It was early afternoon on a midsummer day, but it didn't feel like it. The dense blue-gray storm clouds shaded the sun, leaving everything gloomy, cold, and damp.

Their archaeology group's original plan had been to take airship transport to the City of Stone, southeast of their destination, and catch a ferry with another group of university students to the cheerfully named City of Last Resort. In the past day, a local storm had cropped up, suspending airship travel services. Their group had landed north of their destination instead and split into two smaller groups. The first took the long inland route, boarding a levitating ground line to the City of Stone, where they would charter an express bus to their destination. The second group boarded a sleeper bus for a shorter but grueling twenty-three-hour trip over winding coastal roads with two stops at transit waypoints.

Arthur and Digitalis were in the second group with other instructors and faculty chaperones: the sleeper bus left an hour later than the first group's train and arrived at their destination six hours earlier.

The sleeper bus had compartments for groups of two and four people. Arthur had been hoping to snag a four-person compartment for the extra wing room, but there were only two on that bus and they were already booked.

Having lived in human staff dormitories for most of his childhood, Digitalis saved space by wedging his feathered bluejay wings upward in the back corner. It gave Arthur room to keep his bad wing extended; an old injury caused it to cramp and spasm painfully in tight spaces, even when he took his medication, and the rain made it worse.

"You should get up first, Digit. You've been stuffed in here so tightly," said Arthur while the bus curved onto the ramp to the waypoint. He used his arm to pull in his wing so Digitalis could pass.

"I need to pee and sitting like this helps me hold it," Digitalis reassured him, but gratefully stood up and stretched his legs when the bus trundled to a stop.

"Passengers may exit the bus while refueling," the unigender Grisderm voice said over the speakers. "Twenty minutes are allotted for amenities."

Arthur disembarked behind Digitalis, both stepping down carefully to avoid triggering their landing reflexes. Thick fog crept across the pavement. In the harsh orange halo of the fueling area's lights, the entrance to the depot had a ghostly glow that made it easy to find.

Inside, signs pointed to the various amenities available. One of the other instructors jogged down the hallway marked "showers" while most headed to the restrooms and vending room. Arthur and Digitalis went to the vending room.

"My throat has been dry for the last hour," Digitalis sighed, punching in the code for a large water bottle on one of the drink machines. For such a middle-of-nowhere place, the vending room had a wide drink selection, and Arthur found himself staring at a locally produced drink called "Seabreeze." Arthur bought a can, along with a small bottle of water. After picking out their food, Arthur and Digitalis sat down to eat.

"Did you need to use the bathroom or anything, Bear?" asked Digitalis, gathering and sorting their cardboard plates and boxes for disposal. "We've got about two more minutes."

Neither of them used the restroom, and they returned early to the bus, stopping outside to stretch their wings. The next seven hours ground by slowly, and Arthur and Digitalis passed the time playing word games, reading the paperbacks they'd brought, and dozing off in their seats.

"You haven't opened your uh..." Digitalis sat up and yawned, blinking from Arthur's reading light. "Seabreeze energy drink."

"It's an energy drink?" asked Arthur, and read the side of the can. "So it is. 'Twice the caffeine of big-name brands.' Fancy." The can had a resealable lid, so Arthur twisted it off. It was late, but Arthur thought it wouldn't hurt to try a sip.

Arthur was ready for a strong, sharp taste and wasn't disappointed. The drink was carbonated and thick, tart at first with an aftertaste that was both perfumy and somehow rancid. The bus jolted as it hit a bump, and what was supposed to be a sip became a gulp. It burned on the way down and made Arthur's eyes water.

"Nope," said Arthur, setting the drink down. "Ugh, it's sticking in my throat."

"Can I try?" Digitalis asked. "I could drink it instead of coffee in the morning." Arthur handed him the can.

Digitalis sipped from the can and scrunched up his face. "Yeah. Nope," he agreed. "There's a can disposal by the bathrooms. We can dump it out in the sink." Since he was closer to the curtain, Arthur peeked out. The bathroom was out of order.

"Let's dump it out the window," said Arthur. "We can take it to the disposal next time you or I get up."

The window was unexpectedly heavy. Arthur couldn't hold it up and dump the bottle, so Digitalis held it. The air outside was windy and rainy, and rainwater splashed in while the liquid glugged out of the can.

They folded out the sleeping platform ten minutes later: a double bed that filled the compartment at knee height. Since they both had to step into the middle aisle briefly, Digitalis took the chance to dispose of the energy drink can.

"Have you got any more of your water?" asked Arthur, inspecting the drab gray pillows and blankets that had come with their compartment. He wasn't looking forward to falling asleep if he could: he could still taste the "Seabreeze" drink in the back of his mouth. Arthur's small bottle of water plus about a quarter of Digitalis's larger one had only diminished the perfumy aspect of the flavor, leaving him with the gassy rotted-fruit aftertaste.

"No, I recycled our water bottles with the can," Digitalis yawned, shuffling his wings together so Arthur could have more space on the bed. Arthur wanted to tell him it wasn't necessary, but it was. Arthur extended his wing in the compartment and his cramping eased. Now the only thing bothering him was his bladder; Arthur had been good about rationing his fluid intake until he'd gulped the energy drink, and his abdomen felt tight and distended.

The next waypoint was two hours later. The stop was only ten minutes, and only Digitalis left the bus to get more water. Arthur sat with his legs tightly crossed and raised the window shade to look at the scenery while Digitalis was gone. The overhead speaker had called the waypoint "Scenic Waypoint 147B-A." During the day, the scene would be bright with hardy coniferous plants and brilliant pure blues and greens of the sea. Currently, everything was just really dark except for the muted glow of the Grisderm Homeworld's twin moons, showing through a rare break in the storm clouds.

Arthur distracted himself further by resetting his watch and calculating how much time they had left. He squirmed to stimulate the pee boner in his pants while he punched the numbers in his phone's calculator. It was 11:03 at night and the waypoint schedule had projected that they would stop at 11:15. That meant they would reach their destination at-

A sudden bloom of warmth on Arthur's thigh made him clench up, careful to set his phone aside. He stiffened, breathing shallowly while stretching his wing.

"I'm back," Digitalis announced, stepping out of his flip-flops and half-crawling into the compartment. He shut the curtain and handed Arthur a bottle of water, which was pleasantly cool from the machine. The back of Arthur's mouth tasted gross and he wanted a drink, but thinking about it made his bladder strain. Outside the curtain, footsteps treaded past and the automated voice announced their imminent departure from the waypoint.

"Digit, is the bathroom working again?" Arthur asked, hoping that the bathroom had been fixed somehow during their stop at the waypoint. The chances were slim, but he'd seen stranger things happen on Grisderm transport services.

Digitalis gave him a hesitant expression and leaned out of the curtain. His face didn't change when he pulled himself back to Arthur on the mattress. "No."

"And we threw away our empty bottles, didn't we?" Arthur whispered, not wanting to be heard by the other passengers. The bus lurched to life beneath them. Arthur's concentration on holding his bladder cracked, then shattered as he toppled sideways. "No no no," Arthur gasped. He felt Digitalis's hand on his arm.

"Over here, Bear," Digitalis said quietly. He slid over to the window, keeping his wings compactly behind him, and raised the window, It was drizzling outside, and cool water droplets blew in as the bus picked up speed. Arthur scuttled over on his knees, hurriedly unzipping his jeans.

"You need to switch sides," Arthur said rapidly. "So you're upwind."

Digitalis nodded and neatly swung to the other side of the window. Arthur sprayed the windowsill before he could aim, and let his pants drop to his thighs. His dick was half hard and he stuck it out the window into the wind and rain. He almost couldn't tell he was going at first with the noise and chill from the wind until the pressure lessened. He looked down and saw that his cock was at shoulder height to Digitalis, shooting a hard stream out into the velvet darkness. It finally started to feel good, and Arthur sighed, leaning back to push his hips forward and stretching his wing.

"Thanks, Digit," Arthur breathed. It didn't sound like anyone behind them had opened their windows, and Arthur let himself relax. It crossed his mind that the window was heavy, but it wasn't that heavy, and he trusted Digitalis not to drop it on his most sensitive parts.

The cold from the passing air was starting to numb Arthur down there, so he used his hand to shield himself from the wind.

Arthur seemed to go on pissing forever. Twice, he ran his thumb over the end of his urethra to feel if he was still going. When he finished, he sat back on his haunches, enjoying the relatively warmer air on his groin and hand. Digitalis carefully lowered the window and reached up to the luggage rack to rummage through his carry-on bag.

"Do you still have that gross taste in your mouth?" Digitalis asked, handing Arthur a stack of napkins. Arthur took them and wiped the now cold drops of urine off the windowsill.

"Yeah," sighed Arthur. Digitalis used a packet of sanitizing wipes to swab the window and sill after Arthur and disposed of them in a repurposed shopping bag. Arthur used the napkin to clean himself and a wet wipe on his hands after. He zipped up feeling much better, though with the cold lingering in his crotch area.

"I also have fruit snacks in my bag if that'll help," said Digitalis, secreting the waste bag back into its pocket.

"Aren't they for your baby?" Arthur asked.

"Hydi's two, not a baby," corrected Digitalis. "And these are just the melon-flavored ones she doesn't like. There's more at home. I told Mums she could eat them, but I don't think she likes the melon either."

Arthur liked melon-flavored candy, so he took a packet of fruit snacks and lay back with Digitalis under their bus blankets. Arthur felt relaxed enough to fold his wings and give Digitalis some room for his, and the blankets were surprisingly warm. Arthur found himself starting to drift off quickly.

"Didn't you say you needed to pee too?" Arthur yawned and snuggled up to Digitalis on the mattress.

Digitalis opened his mouth to speak, yawned instead, and started over: "Yeah. I'll hold it until we get to the hotel though. It's cold and I'm cozy under here." They slept for almost six hours, waking fifteen minutes before reaching the City of Last Resort.

"I could still taste that stuff when I woke up," said Arthur. "So when we got here I tried mouthwash, coffee, and stronger coffee after that. You were there when I brushed my teeth."

"Did the melon fruit snacks help?" Millie asked, opening her first container. Arthur was chewing on his food and shook his head. "They have bitter citrus noodles here? Thanks, Digit!"

Digitalis's mouth was full too, so he gave her an emphatic nod and swallowed. "Your usual salad wraps looked iffy so I tried to pick something else you'd like. I got you a Monte Cristo too, for the protein."

"That sounds - pardon the language - fucking amazing," said Millie, digging in with her fold-out vending room cutlery. When they finished eating, they sat in the bath. The perfect cylinder of bubbles had rounded out a bit, but the water was still hot. Arthur and Digitalis rested their wings above the water, and the tops of their heads peeked out over the top. Millie was shorter, and she cleared an area of bubbles around her head so she wouldn't inhale any.

Digitalis puffed some of the bubbles out of his face with a breath. "So...what are 'bathroom buddies' exactly?" He asked, leaving the question open to the other two.

"Just two people who go out and do their uh..." Millie began.

"Bathroom functions," Arthur filled in from his mound of bubbles. "It's a safety thing on remote digs."

"When did it start?" asked Digitalis, sounding apprehensive. Under the hot water, Millie found Digitalis's knee and grasped it.

"Something like fourteen or fifteen years ago?" said Arthur. "Before Mums was born. Millie never expressed interest in a possible rendezvous, and I never asked. I still had my huge crush on Rabb back then."

Millie started, beginning with her first meeting with Arthur on their first dig on the Andyne homeworld.
